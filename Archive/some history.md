How did people in Slovenia feel about becoming independent?
People in Slovenia felt overwhelmingly supportive of becoming independent, as demonstrated by the 1990 independence referendum. In this referendum held on December 23, 1990, about 88.5% of all eligible voters (95.7% of those participating) voted in favor of Slovenia becoming an independent and sovereign state. The turnout was high at 93.2%, showing strong engagement and clear consensus among Slovenians for independence. Only about 4% opposed independence. This strong mandate paved the way for Slovenia's declaration of independence on June 25, 1991, reflecting a broad desire among the population for self-determination and sovereignty separate from Yugoslavia.​
The mood was shaped by political and economic factors, including divisions within Yugoslavia and aspirations for a European future. The referendum had support from various political groups, both center-right and left-wing, and was followed by a brief armed conflict (the Ten-Day War) but ultimately led to the establishment of an independent country recognized by international bodies soon after. This revealed a national consensus and general optimism about Slovenia's path forward as an independent state.
The Ten-Day War was a brief armed conflict that occurred after Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia on June 25, 1991. The war was fought between the Slovenian Territorial Defence, which was Slovenia's local defense force, and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). The conflict started on June 27, 1991, when Yugoslav forces attempted to take control of border posts and strategic points in Slovenia to prevent its secession.
Slovenia had secretly prepared for this conflict by organizing and training the Territorial Defence and by controlling key border crossings, airfields, and infrastructure. The Yugoslav army, mostly dominated by Serbs and Montenegrins, was divided about how to handle Slovenia's independence, eventually opting for a limited military intervention aimed at forcing Slovenia to back down. Slovenian forces used guerrilla tactics and had the advantage of defending their homeland.
The war lasted until July 7, 1991, when the Brioni Accords were signed, leading to a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops. The brief and relatively low-casualty conflict ended with Slovenia effectively securing its independence, marking the start of the broader Yugoslav Wars that followed in other republics.
