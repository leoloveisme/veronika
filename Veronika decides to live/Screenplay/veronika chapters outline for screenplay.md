sucking on the breast) FADE OUT NEXT DAY - SLOW FADE IN (to still sleeping
Veronika and boy; they gradually wake up; Veronika breastfeeds the boy) INT -
Breakfast room - MORNING (friendly chitchat with some breakfast table
neighbours) INT - Indian consulate - DAY (Getting the passport back with the
issued visa) (Veronika walks out of the building, while holding the passport in
her hand. Veronika stops, opens it to check the accuracy) CAMERA SHOT INTO THE
PASSPORT OPENED DISPLAYING INDIAN VISA 

// I'm still not sure if I should include it into the book or not EXT - Outside
of Embassy - DAY VERONIKA (angrily) Fuck! (going back to the gates) There is a
mistake. It's not my family name. EMBASSY GUARD Ma..am, you need to come
tomorrow again. Do we want to go the path of the visa issued with an error, you
have to come tomorrow; strong emotional reaction of Veronika, time needed to
correct the visa, another night in hotel, etc ??? OC What doesn't kill us,
makes us stronger...

BACK in Bern INT - Bedroom - NIGHT After she has packed everything and put boy
to bed, she set up the baby phone and went to / came into Eduard's studio....
She knew that she has got at least 2 - 3 hours before she would need to feed
the boy... VO (in Veronika voice) Normal women, who breastfeed usually lose
their libido during the breastfeeding time - not me though, my libido has
actually become amplified (parting sex (which was initiated by Veronika) and
which will conceive their daughter) <- this will be deleted later from the book
/ script INT - EDUARD'S STUDIO ROOM - NIGHT Veronika enters the studio with a
thick wool blanket over her shoulder Kisses Eduard Steps away and spreads out
the blanket on the floor while Eduard amused and in bewilderment watches what
Veronika is doing She half lies down onto the blanket and waves with the hand
to Eduard to come (come, come) The whole day she was preparing herself for this
\- she rubbed herself against him like a horny cat in May - in the kitchen, in
his studio - when she came to call him for lunch and dinner to his bewilderment
keeping him thinking what is actually going on today :) When he came to the
blanket and copied her pose she pressed him onto his shoulders, him ending up
lying on his back and ... she kissed and rode him, she rode and kissed him very
well that night. In the morning Eduard drives them to the airport. They kiss
and she waves goodbye, after having entered the gate.

## India

(entry New Delhi November 1999) DATE / PLACE DISPLAY ON SCR. November 1999, New
Delhi New Delhi North India Agra Lucknow Mumbai Chennai Puducherry Varkala some
persistent interest from a male over several days He was very well behaved and
extremely polite ALL the fucking time and this appalled me and on the other
hand made him extremely attractive for me. When I was returning from the yoga
session for mothers - there were all kind of women there: Russian, Indian,
Australian and me; I was not in my best shape and yet he has overshowered me
with compliments for how beautiful I am and how great I look. INT - some
restaurant overlooking ocean - DAY (Veronika and male have a conversation,
while Veronika breastfeeds the boy) INT - Veronika's hotel room - SAME DAY kiss
scene He starts gently undress her She plays with his hair sudden vomit
reaction (Veronika) Veronika runs into the bathroom I apologised and run into
the bathroom The guy remained staying speechless for some time and then just
left the male being the gentlemen leaves while she is still in the bathroom (so
she discovers / becomes aware that she is pregnant) (Emotional break down) FADE
OUT EXT - Outside of the hotel - NEXT DAY (Took Took is there - leaving for
Kochi - drive to the train station) VO (in Veronika voice) It is heavy enough
with one child and now there is a second one growing in my belly CONT'D VO (in
Veronika voice) shall I make an abortion? No one would know about that (What
stops her from having that abortion? What stops her from having abortion in the
end?) VO (in Veronika voice) I almost killed myself once... How can I cancel
the life which doesn't truly belong to me? Should I not leave that decision to
the child? (India can be VERY overwhelming and so can be unexpected pregnancy,
when combined they lead one to the state of deep despair) Eduard comes to India
for support and they go to Goa: first Agonda and then Arambol and then return
to Switzerland

## Journey into friendship with cold begins.

South-East Asia (work) Bangkok North Thailand Journey into friendship with cold
begins. EXT - North Thailand - NIGHT VO (in Veronika voice) It supposed to be
warm in tropical countries – however being here in December in the North of
Thailand has brought the memories of North India. EPISODE EXT - North India -
NIGHT (flashback to the time when Veronika was in the North India) (Veronika is
having warm clothes in the mountains of North India) CONT'D VO (in Veronika
voice) It's fucking great that we left for India in November, when it was
already pretty cold in Slovenia, otherwise we would be freezing our bones here.
EXT - North Thailand - NIGHT CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice) Somehow I didn't
know that it would be the same in Thailand. (If you cannot beat them, join them
or in my case it was if you cannot beat it, get accustomed to it, make yourself
friends with it, and this is exactly where and how my journey into making
friend with cold has started. Ironically in a very warm tropical country.) It's
good that we flew here in December and had our warm clothes with us. CONT'D VO
(in Veronika voice) My whole life is an absolute irony of my choices, of me
making those choices and living with them. EXT - PATH UP THE MOUNTAIN - MORNING
(Veronika went for a run and a swim in a cold-ish mountain lake overcoming fear
of water) FLASHBACK TO CHILDHOOD EXT - LAKE - DAY (little Veronika is drowning
in a lake) (when she was a child and nearly drowned and was saved by ....
whom?) CONT'D EXT - PATH UP THE MOUNTAIN - MORNING (Veronika runs into the
water and dives) Well, that didn't kill me. 

(Decision to “become friends with cold” despite tropical latitude — internal
paradox established.)

## Rush for life

Auroville clinique coma & return to Slovenia And I ended up in hospital, again.
In a hospital similar to Villette I don't know about Eduard, however I
passionately hated ALL hospitals after Villette and something in my gut tells
me that Eduard might've shared my sentiment. Seeing everything what was
happening around me in the hospital and beyond and not being able to change
anything is - I don't know how to put it mildly - disheartening.
