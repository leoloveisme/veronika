some persistent interest from a male over several days
He was very well behaved and extremely polite ALL the fucking time and this appalled me and on the other hand made him extremely attractive for me. 
When I was returning from the yoga session for mothers - there were all kind of women there: Russian, Indian, Australian and me; I was not in my best shape and yet he has overshowered me with compliments for how beautiful I am and how great I look. 
INT - some restaurant overlooking ocean - DAY
(Veronika and male have a conversation, while Veronika breastfeeds the boy)
INT - Veronika's hotel room - SAME DAY
kiss scene 
He starts gently undress her
She plays with his hair
sudden vomit reaction (Veronika)
Veronika runs into the bathroom
I apologised and run into the bathroom
The guy remained staying speechless for some time and then just left
the male being the gentlemen leaves while she is still in the bathroom
(so she discovers / becomes aware that she is pregnant)
(Emotional break down)
FADE OUT
EXT - Outside of the hotel - NEXT DAY
(Took Took is there - leaving for Kochi - drive to the train station)
VO (in Veronika voice)
It is heavy enough with one child
and now there is a second one growing in my belly
CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice)
shall I make an abortion?
No one would know about that
(What stops her from having that abortion?
What stops her from having abortion in the end?)
VO (in Veronika voice)
I almost killed myself once...
How can I cancel the life which doesn't truly belong to me? Should I not leave that decision to the child?
(India can be VERY overwhelming and so can be unexpected pregnancy, when combined they lead one to the state of deep despair)
Eduard comes to India for support and they go to Goa: first Agonda and then Arambol 
and then return to Switzerland
