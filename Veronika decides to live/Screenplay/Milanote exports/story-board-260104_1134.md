EPISODE

CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice)

It's fucking great that we left for India in November, when it was already pretty cold in Slovenia, otherwise we would be freezing our bones here.

EXT - North Thailand - NIGHT

CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice)

Somehow I didn't know that it would be the same in Thailand.

(If you cannot beat them, join them or in my case it was if you cannot beat it, get accustomed to it, make yourself friends with it, and this is exactly where and how my journey into making friend with cold has started. Ironically in a very warm tropical country.)

It's good that we flew here in December and had our warm clothes with us.

CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice)

My whole life is an absolute irony of my choices, of me making those choices and living with them.
