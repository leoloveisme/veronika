Apocalypse now	
Life goes on	
What’s next?	
Preparing for India	
India
- Fire	
Hello Great Britain	
Spain, here I come
The cage door is open at last	
Journey into friendship with cold begins
- Water
One, two, three … swimming we go
Madness or bravery	
Wild wild everything	
Latin America	
Locked-in freedom
Roots and flames	
India again	
Rush for life	
Now - it’s the time	
Veronika decides to live
