Intro	
Apocalypse now	
Life goes on	
What’s next?	
Preparing for India	
India	
Some years of life (after India)	
Spain, here I come
The cage door is open at last	
Journey into friendship with cold begins
One, two, three … swimming we go	
Madness or bravery	
Wild wild everything	
Latin America	
Locked-in freedom	
India again	
Rush for life	
Now - it’s the time	
Veronika decides to live
