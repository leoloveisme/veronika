Once in a while there comes the time when you stop and you ask yourself - What is it all for? All this travelling, all these documentaries you're making and then the apathy and despair creep in. With the power of your mind you keep pushing them away and the stronger you push them away the stronger they come back at you.
Yoga and meditation has taught me how to control these situations and still there are the times when the power of will power becomes drined out of it's juice of it's energy and force and exactly then these ways of despair cover you completely - like ways in the oceans - the coveryou over your head, they sweep you of your feet, these waves go all over your body and it is very difficult to regain the control (over your head and over your body) Nothing seems to natter, nothing gives you joy and power to live. 
What pulls me out of this deep state and helps me getting back to my feet usually are the thoughts that I must have not yet fullfilled my life purpose, otherwise I would've been already taken long time ago. There is still something I have to do. If I'm still alive, then there is still something to do for me in this life. 

Since the incident with Vilette, I became very sceptical of "people in the white robes" and of people who practise traditional medicine, that's why when they told me that I have a cancerous tumor in my right breast - initially I was shoked and later when the initial shock subued I took it with a grain of salt and decided to take some time off - off work, off regular day to day life and exactly on this day I bought tickets to Thailand. 

TL;DR / Summmary
