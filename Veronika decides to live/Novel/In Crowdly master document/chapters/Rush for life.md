Auroville clinique
coma & return to Slovenia
And I ended up in hospital, again. 
In a hospital similar to Villette 
I don't know about Eduard, however I passionately hated ALL hospitals after Villette and something in my gut tells me that Eduard might've shared my sentiment. 
Seeing everything what was happening around me in the hospital and beyond and not being able to change anything is - I don't know how to put it mildly - disheartening.
