Andalusia - sudden discovery of a yoga and breathwork retreat in the hills of Andalusia 
August 2004
Throughout his life Eduard was not very talkative outside of the family. Within the family he wasn’t a chatter box either, however he loved both children and we (he and I) talked about pretty much everything, as well. And at times – yes, he absolutely was a chatterbox. And this were memorable moments, as well. Both children were off the breast for quite some time now and the question “What’s next” resurfaced again.

It’s a luxury only a few can afford themselves nowadays to get lost in the hill of Andalusia without any plans or agenda. And this is exactly where I see them – doing yoga in the morning rose-pink light. And something in mir says – yes, it is them, this is exactly where I supposed to be.
