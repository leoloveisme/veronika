Veronika's writing career takes off 
They (Veronika & Eduard) become VERY wealthy 
The time since our escape from the “mad house” and our marriage just flew: 
There was so much change in the world and me becoming pregnant with our first child also somewhat contributed to that too, then the second child was born as well and somehow after all these sleepless days and nights and you experiencing the reality as if in the haze also contributed to The fall of the Berlin wall opened and the collapse of the Soviet Union has started new era of life. Shortly after Slovenia became it’s own country and became independent. Due to my looks (both males and females found me extremely attractive) and hopefuly to my brains it was quite easy to become an new anchor on the Slovenian TV and later on one of the major UK TV channels and I was quite a decent writer, too. Writing fell easy for me and I felt that I was good at words; both written and spoken. Strangelly enough words appeared in my head as by themselves flying in quickly like commets with their cosmic speed. My children ended up seeing me more on the TV screen than at home When you give birth to a child or more than one you're kind of expected to know everything. At least this is the expectation the world places on you. And it is quite dishearthening to know that this expection / these expectations are far far away, thousands upon thousands miles away from the reality you live day after day after day. Just imagine the mountain Everest of expectations placed onto the fragile shoulders of underage mothers. Technically I wasn’t underage, however from the general ripeness I was also quite far. 

And even though I was not underage when I gave birth to our first child, I still was very far from being perfect person and perfect mother. Veronika's writing career takes off They (Veronika & Eduard) become VERY wealthy
