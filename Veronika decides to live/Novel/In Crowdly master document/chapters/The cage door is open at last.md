Since Slovenia joined the EU it became very easy to travel. 

In 2004 Slovenia joined the EU and the doors into the world were practically open for everyone. And it practically was the time for me to go to Madrid, again, where I would ….

Once one gets bitten by “travel bug” one gets it running for quite a long while / time and some never get off it.Seeing other countries and experiencing other cultures, beautiful architecture and bright vibrant clothes of the south, eating tasty foods and fruits.All this makes us wanting more: other countries, other foods and fruits, other clothes and different architecture. However I didn’t know all this at the time of me preparing for my very first trip to India. India is one of the countries, which has very different architecture, from Mogul inspired to French, tasty fruits and nasty monkeys and crows, which will steal your food, at any given opportunity and before you get to know all that you have to travel there and to experience stories told by people who travelled and shared stories about their amazing or not so amazing travel experiences

And then one day I had some pain in the right breast
I went to the doctors 
They said that they would need to operate me
I joked now I will be like real life Amazonian
They used fire to get rid of the right breast because it would prevent them from using / shooting bows
I would be able to shoot bows perfectly

To gather my thoughts I said to Eduard, that I'll go to South-East Asia with my crew and will stay there a bit longer after the work will be done.

It would turn out that the diagnose was false, but that she would get to know later. 

TL;DR / Summmary

Veronika is diagnosed with cancer 
She goes to Thailand and some other countries of South-East Asia and confronts her fears
