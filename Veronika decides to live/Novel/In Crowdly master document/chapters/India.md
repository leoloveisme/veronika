When I was a child I was drowning once and even though I was rescued timely - and later into the years I learned how to swim - respect for water remained, that why when an old Gypsy woman told her once that I will die of drowning it even emphasized the cocktail of fear and respect for water together. These words of this old Gypsy woman, you can say, remained stuck with her, and became deeply ingrained into her. I always was and is very cautions when entering water and when I was in water. That why I was not very thrilled about when I was invited to drive or go swimming, especially in somewhat dangerous unsupervised waters like sea or even more cautions when it was about an ocean, like it was here in India. 

**Varkala**

some persistent interest from a male over several days
He was very well behaved and extremely polite ALL the fucking time and this appalled me and on the other hand made him extremely attractive for me. 
When I was returning from the yoga session for mothers - there were all kind of women there: Russian, Indian, Australian and me; I was not in my best shape and yet he has overshowered me with compliments for how beautiful I am and how great I look. 
INT - some restaurant overlooking ocean - DAY
(Veronika and male have a conversation, while Veronika breastfeeds the boy)
INT - Veronika's hotel room - SAME DAY
kiss scene 
He starts gently undress her
She plays with his hair
sudden vomit reaction (Veronika)
Veronika runs into the bathroom
I apologised and run into the bathroom
The guy remained staying speechless for some time and then just left
the male being the gentlemen leaves while she is still in the bathroom
(so she discovers / becomes aware that she is pregnant)
(Emotional break down)
FADE OUT
EXT - Outside of the hotel - NEXT DAY
(Took Took is there - leaving for Kochi - drive to the train station)
VO (in Veronika voice)
It is heavy enough with one child
and now there is a second one growing in my belly
CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice)
shall I make an abortion?
No one would know about that
(What stops her from having that abortion?
What stops her from having abortion in the end?)
VO (in Veronika voice)
I almost killed myself once...
How can I cancel the life which doesn't truly belong to me? Should I not leave that decision to the child?
(India can be VERY overwhelming and so can be unexpected pregnancy, when combined they lead one to the state of deep despair)
Eduard comes to India for support and they go to Goa: first Agonda and then Arambol 
and then return to Switzerland

some persistent interest from a male over several days
He was very well behaved and extremely polite ALL the fucking time and this appauled me and on the other hand made him etremely attractive for me. 
I was returning from my yoga session in the morning and even though it was morning it was already very hot. When I was returning from the yoga session for mothers - there were all kind of women there: Russian, Indian, Australian and me; I was not in my best shape and yet he has overshowered me with compliments for how beautiful I am and how great I look. I met a guy, who besides showering me with compliments every time he saw me, even when I didn’t look very appealing, not that I cared. 
He gave me some books to read 
He invited me into one of the local restaurants we had a lunch, spoke about pretty much under sun. I told him about the books I was reading and he was telling me about the books he was reading and in return I exchanged a couple of books, which I already read at the local book shop and gave him two books as a gift, because he told me that he haven’t read them yet: 
“Shantaram” - story of love, friendship and war and “Fine Balance” - a very depressing one and nevertheless quite accurately depicting India as it was before, which in turn helps one to grasp / understand why it is still the way it is now. 
Next day our paths have crossed again. Was he stocking me? And he invited me to another restaurant. The restaurant was overlooking ocean and I as usually ate while I breastfed my boyThe conversation was light and flew easily and unconstrained. Once we were done, he walked us to our hotel and I invited him to come to the room
In the room I put the boy to bed and he came to me and kissed me
He started gently undress her
I played with his hair
sudden vomit reaction (Veronika) 
VERONIKA
and I vomitted directly onto him
I apologized and run into the bathroom
The guy remained staying speechless for some time and then just left
When I came out – he has already left. 
(the male being a gentlemen leaves while I is still in the bathroom)
(Emotional breakdown)
(so I discovered / became aware that I am pregnant)
Fuck, I’m pregnant, again.
Finding out that I was pregnant was an interesting surprise.

India can be VERY overwhelming and so can be unexpected pregnancy, when combined they lead one to the state of deep despair and then your fate adds fire into your life.

## Fire

Eduard comes to India for support and they go to Goa: first Agonda, then Arambol 

VERONIKA
It was a regular resort in India, in which I already stayed many times across India. 
EDUARD
Luckily it was the night before our departure and I packed almost all of our things 
I woke up feeling that it became unusually hot in our room. When I opened my eyes I saw some kind of weird light at the ceiling area of our room. It took me some time to understand what was going on here. I jumped to my feet, kneeled myself onto the bed and gently pushed Veronika trying to wake her. Luckily she woke up relatively easy. When I saw the light in her eyes and her conscious receiving me - I've shown to her what was going on. She nearly shouted "Oh my God". I put my finger to the lips, indicating that she should be quiet. She took Luka from the crib and I walked them out of the door. Once they were at the safe distance I explained to Veronika that I need to go back to get our stuff and I went back - in parallel knocking on the doors and waking up people. Soon the whole area was very loud. People were shouting and articulating, while I was carrying our lagguage out of our room. I didn't dare to return for the stroller, because the fire became quite strong already. 
We didn't sleep that night anymore. In the morning we as we were were taken to the airport and then we flew first to New Delhi and from there - to Switzerland 

**TL;DR / Summary**

Veronika flies to India with her baby boy Luka
She travels from the north of India to the south
She discovers that she is pregnant with the second child
Closer to the end of their journey Eduard comes into India, too and they all return back to Switzerland
