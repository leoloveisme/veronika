Journey into friendship with cold begins.
EXT - North Thailand - NIGHT
VO (in Veronika voice)
It supposed to be warm in tropical countries – however being here in December in the North of Thailand has brought the memories of North India.
EPISODE
EXT - North India - NIGHT
(flashback to the time when Veronika was in the North India)
(Veronika is having warm clothes in the mountains of North India)
CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice)
It's fucking great that we left for India in November, when it was already pretty cold in Slovenia, otherwise we would be freezing our bones here.
EXT - North Thailand - NIGHT
CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice)
Somehow I didn't know that it would be the same in Thailand.
(If you cannot beat them, join them or in my case it was if you cannot beat it, get accustomed to it, make yourself friends with it, and this is exactly where and how my journey into making friend with cold has started. Ironically in a very warm tropical country.)
It's good that we flew here in December and had our warm clothes with us.
CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice)
My whole life is an absolute irony of my choices, of me making those choices and living with them.
EXT - PATH UP THE MOUNTAIN - MORNING
(Veronika went for a run and a swim in a cold-ish mountain lake overcoming fear of water)
FLASHBACK TO CHILDHOOD
EXT - LAKE - DAY
(little Veronika is drowning in a lake)
(when she was a child and nearly drowned and was saved by .... whom?)
CONT'D EXT - PATH UP THE MOUNTAIN - MORNING
(Veronika runs into the water and dives)
Well, that didn't kill me. 

(Decision to “become friends with cold” despite tropical latitude — internal paradox established.)
