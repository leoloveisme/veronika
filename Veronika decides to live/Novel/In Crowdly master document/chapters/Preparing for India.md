VERONIKA
(angrily)
Fuck!
(going back to the gates)
There is a mistake. 
It's not my family name. 
EMBASSY GUARD
Ma..am, you need to come tomorrow again. 
Do we want to go the path of the visa issued with an error, you have to come tomorrow; strong emotional reaction of Veronika, time needed to correct the visa, another night in hotel, etc
???

What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger...

BACK in Bern
INT - Bedroom - NIGHT
After she has packed everything and put boy to bed, she set up the baby phone and went to / came into Eduard's studio.... 
She knew that she has got at least 2 - 3 hours before she would need to feed the boy... 
VO (in Veronika voice)
Normal women, who breastfeed usually lose their libido during the breastfeeding time - not me though, my libido has actually become amplified
(parting sex (which was initiated by Veronika) and which will conceive their daughter) <- this will be deleted later from the book / script
INT - EDUARD'S STUDIO ROOM - NIGHT
Veronika enters the studio with a thick wool blanket over her shoulder Kisses Eduard Steps away and spreads out the blanket on the floor while Eduard amused and in bewilderment watches what Veronika is doing She half lies down onto the blanket and waves with the hand to Eduard to come (come, come)
The whole day she was preparing herself for this - she rubbed herself against him like a horny cat in May - in the kitchen, in his studio - when she came to call him for lunch and dinner to his bewilderment keeping him thinking what is actually going on today :) 
When he came to the blanket and copied her pose she pressed him onto his shoulders, him ending up lying on his back and ... 
she kissed and rode him, she rode and kissed him very well that night.
In the morning Eduard drives them to the airport. They kiss and she waves goodbye, after having entered the gate.
