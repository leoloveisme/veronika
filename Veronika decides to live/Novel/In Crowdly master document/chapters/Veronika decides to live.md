August 2025 EXT - on street in Gaza - DAY (Veronika speaks in Arabic to
children she wants to lead to shelter) OS - COMMs between military COMMANDER
There is something suspicions in the Sector XYZ. Send a drone there. DRONE
PILOT Done, sir. Drone in the sky above Gaza (Camera follows a rocket leaving
fiery trail in the sky and flying towards a building and crashing into it)
CONT'D EXT - on street in Gaza - DAY (devastation - partially or fully
demolished building - heat and smoke) It was a blast that deformed yet another
piece of a building, now resembling the rest of the nearly completely
demolished neighborhood…she's saving five specific kids:Twins 6 y.o. : Jamal
and Amal (girl, scared of the drone sounds)Omar (5, boy, holding his sister's
hand), Noor (girl) 8 y.o. and Yasmin (3, crying, won't let go of a stuffed
animal)We need to SEE her:Learning their names in broken ArabicWiping dust from
Yasmin's faceTelling them: "We're going to run to that building, okay? On
three. One, two..."Then the drone strikes.Not abstract. Not distant. Specific
bodies. Specific loss.I had gathered them— all five of them children, wide-eyed
and “starved to the bone” thin, their small hands clutching mine as I whispered
promises of a safer place just beyond the rubble. We moved quickly through the
choking dust, past twisted metal and shattered homes, toward what I hoped was
shelter. They trusted me, this stranger with the foreign accent who spoke of
gardens and cold waters far away. I was trying to save them, to lead them out
of this furnace of heat and destruction. But the next blast came without
warning. The ground erupted. Bodies flew like fragile leaves in a storm. When
the smoke settled, the children lay still. They would never see their parents
again, nor their siblings, friends, or neighbors. Neither would I.War is a
heartless machine, a creation of politicians. It takes no precautions and
differentiates nothing among beings: be it a cat, a dog, a child, or a
grown-up. Heat and destruction are bad partners; add dust and smoke, and you
have a nearly apocalyptic premise laid out right before our eyes.In that
moment, as the scorching August sun burned down on the ruins of Gaza City—
where famine had taken hold weeks earlier and the temperatures soared past 40°C
and aid trickled like blood from a dying wound — I felt the old paradox rise in
me one final time. Bravery or madness? All my life, I had plunged into extremes
to feel alive: the icy waters of Iceland shocking my skin, the viper's bite in
Auroville sending me into coma darkness, the spiritual fires of India and
Amazonia burning away illusions. I had decided to live, over and over—escaping
Villete with Eduard, building our wild love, raising our quiet blond boy and
fiery black-haired girl amid moves and gardens across the world. And now, here
in this man-made hell, I had come not for myself, but for them. For the
starving, the displaced, the children whose eyes mirrored my own long-ago
despair. One last plunge, into the heart of indifference. As my vision faded
amid the rubble, I thought of Eduard’s paintings, the children grown and
carrying our flame, the piano notes from Villete echoing faintly. I had lived
by other laws. I had chosen sanity over madness and bravery over indifference.
And in the end, the machine took me too.

MATEJ (calling Eduard on the telephone)
We finished filming. I turned around to pack the equipment. When I was finished packing and turned back to the place where Veronika was staying just to discover that she was gone. She told me something to my back, but I didn't pay attention, because I was busy packing. 
I don't know how to say it. 
Veronika is dead.
I'm VERY SORRY man. 

End with a scene of one person we've never met—maybe a teenage girl in
Ljubljana—reading Veronika's book in a hospital bed (echo of Villete). She's
considering suicide. She reads the last page. She closes the book. She looks
out the window.She decides to live and her name is Veronika, too! and she is a
daughter of Ukrainian refugees. DAY 1 - Initial coldness MARIJA(cheerful, from
her bed)What's your name, dear? VERONIKA II doesn't turn around. Stares at the
wall. VERONIKA II(flat, doing her a "favor")Veronika. MARIJA(warm, unfazed)Ah!
Beautiful name. My mother's name was Veronika.I'm Marija. VERONIKA II(barely
audible)Okay. She turns her back to Marija. Pulls the blanket over her head.
Marija watches her for a moment—then goes back to knitting. She hums softly. A
Slovenian folk song. DAY 2 - Marija's daughter visits VERONIKA II pretends to
sleep. Marija's DAUGHTER (40s, kind face) brings a bag of food, magazines, and
two books. DAUGHTER Here's the books you asked for, Mama. MARIJA(taking it,
glancing at Veronika II's turned back) Thank you, ljubica. After some time the
daughter leaves. Marija reads for a while—then places the book on the shared
nightstand between the beds. Cover facing up: "Veronika Decides to Live."
Veronika II's eyes flicker open—just for a second—to see the title. She closes
them again. DAY 3 - The thaw VERONIKA II wakes in the night. Can't sleep.
Reaches for the book—hesitates—then pulls it into her hands. Starts reading by
the dim nightlight. MARIJA stirs, half-awake. MARIJA(sleepy, gentle) Good book,
that one. Made me cry. Veronika II freezes—caught. VERONIKA II (defensive) I
wasn't MARIJA (cutting her off, kind) It's okay. Read it. Keep it, if you want.
She rolls over, goes back to sleep. Veronika II stares at the book. Then keeps
reading. DAY 4/5 - Marija is discharged MARIJA packs her things. Veronika II
watches from her bed—hasn't spoken much, but her posture is different. Less
defensive. MARIJA (at the door, turning back) Veronika? Veronika II looks up.
MARIJA (CONT'D) (simply, no drama) I'm glad I met you. She smiles—warm,
genuine—and leaves. Veronika II is alone now. She looks at the books still on
the nightstand. Picks it up. Keeps reading. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LJUBLJANA -
DAY (JANUARY 2026) Pale winter light filters through the window. VERONIKA II
(16) sits propped up in bed with the book in her hands — final pages. She reads
in silence. Her jaw tightens. Her eyes redden—but she doesn't cry. She finishes
the last sentence. Closes the book slowly. Stares at the cover: "Veronika
decides to live" VERONIKA II (whispered, in Ukrainian-accented Slovene) Ty
durna zhinka.(You stupid woman.) She looks out the window—the city sprawls
below, gray and ordinary and full of people living their small, precious lives.
VERONIKA II (CONT'D) (softer, to the book) But you tried. She places the book
on the bedside table—carefully, like it's sacred. Reaches for the call
button.Presses it.VERONIKA II (CONT'D)(to herself, almost a vow)Okay. I'll try,
too.She looks back out the window. The city is still gray. But the light is
different now. CUT TO EXT - MOUNTAINS OVERLOOKING OCEAN - DAY VERONIKA, HER
HUSBAND AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN are hiking in the mountains. TITLE CARD:"For
everyone still deciding."
