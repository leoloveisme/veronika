swimming in ice-cold waters alone 
Now when I already swam with some of the world most renowned ice swimmers I also wanted to try the cold waters of Iceland. Is it a sign of bravery or a sigh of an absolute and sheer madness to wager into such a swim absolutely alone?It is way easier to swim with the others, however to do it completely alone… One needs to confront one’s own fears and either overcome them or succumb and surrender to them and this is exactly what I was doing when the thoughts of fear came to my headFuck it let’s do it, nothing is under control – is the motto which I welcomed into my life and was using when faced by situations of uncertainty, fear and even danger
There are calculable risks and there is sheer madness and mad braveryWhat swimming alone is, only the time will show. Ask me later and I’ll tell you once I did / have done it. 
The title "Iceland" works well for now: it’s simple, geographic, and carries that stark, cold resonance. If you want alternatives later, something like "Alone in the North Atlantic", "The Solitary Plunge", or "Madness or Bravery" (echoing the question you pose) could add a more poetic or philosophical layer. But honestly, the plain "Iceland" has a Coelho-esque minimalism that fits the spirit of the original novel.
