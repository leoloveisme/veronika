to live fearlessly. 

And I ended up in hospital, again. In a hospital similar to Villette 

I don't know about Eduard, however I passionately hated ALL hospitals after
Villette and something in my gut tells me that Eduard might've shared my
sentiment. 

Seeing everything what was happening around me in the hospital and beyond and
not being able to change anything is - I don't know how to put it mildly -
disheartening.

Once I woke up from coma, in that moment, I knew that I was no longer the
choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a
second chance at life, or this was perhaps my moment of transition. When I
woke, it already was an afternoon, I was enormously surprised to discover that
I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my life.
And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality.
Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light
burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could
not pick a voice out from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape.
Because I could not identify the position of my body in space, I felt enormous
and expansive, like a genie just liberated from her bottle. And my spirit
soared free, like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria.
Nirvana. I found Nirvana, again. And I remember thinking, there's no way I
would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny
little body. But then I realized, "But I'm still alive! I'm still alive, and I
experienced Nirvana, again. And if I could experience Nirvana again, while
being alive, then everyone who is alive can experience it, too" And I pictured
a world filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people who knew
that they could come to this space at any time. And that they could purposely
choose to step to the right hemisphere – by doing yoga and meditations - and
find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience
could be, what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives. And
it motivated me to recover and to come back. So who are we? We are the
life-force power of the universe, with manual dexterity and two cognitive
minds. And we have the power to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want
to be in the world. Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness of
my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I
am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that
make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into the
consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become a single individual, a
solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Veronika intellectual,
journalist, TV presenter and story-teller, caring mother to my children and
loving wife to my husband and daughter to my parents. These are the "we" inside
of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that
the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry of our
right hemispheres, the more peace we will project into the world, and the more
peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an ideal time to live the
life I was given, again.

VERONIKA 

Hi, mom. 

MOTHER 

How do you feel, dear? 

VERONIKA 

I'm good, mom. 

MOTHER 

Darling, do you remember Dr. Igor? 

VERONIKA 

Of course, I do. What about him? 

MOTHER 

Well, I read in the paper that he died of a heart attack, yesterday. 

VERONIKA

(remains facially unchanged, however there are tears formed in her eyes)

Thanks, mom. We'll speak later. 

(Veronika wipes off the tears from her face)

MOTHER 

Bye bye, darling.

Once I woke up from the coma in Ljubljana, the venom finally flushed from my
veins, I knew I was no longer the sole choreographer of my life. I had felt my
spirit surrender. I had said goodbye — quietly, almost gratefully — to the
story I had been writing with every border crossed, every icy plunge, every
reckless yes. Light had burned like wildfire behind my eyes, sounds had crashed
like chaos, and for a while I was enormous — a genie freed from the bottle of
my body, gliding through silent euphoria. Nirvana. I had found it. And then I
woke up. Still alive. Again. I remember thinking: if I can touch that vastness
and still be breathing, then anyone can. Everyone who is alive can choose, at
any moment, to step into that space of deep peace. And in the same breath, they
can choose the smaller, sharper “I” — the one with a name, a passport, children
waiting at home, a husband who paints while the polar night lasts. These two
“we” live inside me. One is the life-force power of the universe — boundless,
at one with everything, fearless because there is no edge to fall off. The
other is Veronika: intellectual, journalist, TV presenter, storyteller, mother
to my quiet blond boy and fiery black-haired girl, loving wife to Eduard,
daughter to my parents. I have spent decades running the circuitry of intensity
— chasing sensation to prove I was still here. But in that coma I learned I
could also run the circuitry of peace. And suddenly the running stopped feeling
necessary. I came home different. I stayed longer. I watched the children grow.
I sat with Eduard in silence that didn’t itch. For the first time, ordinary
days didn’t terrify me. But the world kept burning. Images reached me: children
in Gaza, thin as winter twigs, eyes carrying the same hollow question I once
carried in Villette. Famine declared, temperatures brutal, homes reduced to
rubble mountains, aid crawling in too late. I understood then what the second
chance was truly for. Not to sit safely in the peace I had found. But to carry
it into the places where peace had been bombed out of existence. One last time,
I left. Eduard kissed me at the airport the way he always did — no pleas, no
drama, just trust and the quiet knowledge that I might not return. The children
hugged me harder than usual. They were old enough now to feel the weight. I
entered Gaza in August 2025. It was a blast that deformed yet another piece of
a building, now resembling the rest of the nearly completely demolished
neighborhood…\\\[Continue directly with the exact Gaza text you already wrote,
ending on:]…And in the end, the machine took me too. I came home different.
They had flown me to Ljubljana in May, while I was still deep in the coma —
back to the city where the story began, back to hospital corridors that once
rang with my fury at surviving. When I finally woke, late spring was already
turning the city green. For the first time in decades, I stayed. Not forever —
just those couple of months while my body finished healing, while Ljubljana’s
grey winter memories from the past faded into a hesitant spring and then a
full, warm summer. The children were already grown — our quiet blond boy and
fiery black-haired girl now in their mid-twenties, shaping lives of their own.
Our girl found her rooting in Columbia as an English teacher. and our boy
stayed in the UK, well, at least for now. His IT start-up is promising and he
might need to relocate to the US. The time will show. They came and went,
bringing their new sharpness and laughter into the house. We shared long meals
on the terrace, walks along the river, silences with Eduard that felt full
instead of restless. Life became quieter, deeper. The old terror of ordinary
days receded — like a tide that had learned it could ebb without drowning me.
The running stopped. For one summer. For a few very short months. Then, one hot
morning in early August 2025, the news reached me. Dr. Igor — the psychiatrist,
who had once lied that my heart was failing, the lie that hurled me into life —
had died suddenly of a massive heart attack. They flew me home to Ljubljana
while I was still unconscious — back to the city where it all began, back to
the same hospital corridors that once echoed with my rage at being alive. When
I woke from the coma, the venom finally purged, I knew I was no longer the sole
choreographer of my life. I had surrendered. I had said goodbye — not in
despair this time, but in a vast, silent euphoria. Light had burned like
wildfire, sounds had crashed like chaos, and for a while I was boundless — a
genie freed from the bottle of my body, gliding through an ocean of peace.
Nirvana. I had touched it. And then I woke up. Still alive. Again. The doctors
told me later how close it had been. Eduard had sat by my bed for weeks,
painting nothing, just holding my hand through the long polar night. The
children had taken turns reading to me. My parents had prayed. I remember
thinking: if I can touch that vastness and still return to this small body,
then anyone can. Everyone who is alive can choose, moment by moment, which
circuitry to run — the deep inner peace of boundlessness, or the sharp,
separate “I” with a name, a history, people waiting. These two “we” live inside
me. One is the life-force power of the universe — at one with everything,
fearless because there are no edges. The other is Veronika: journalist,
storyteller, mother to my quiet blond boy and fiery black-haired girl, loving
wife to Eduard, daughter to my parents. For decades I had run only the
circuitry of intensity, chasing proof that I was still here. But in that coma I
learned I could also choose peace. And for the first time, ordinary days no
longer felt like a slow death. I stayed home longer. I watched the children
finish growing. I sat with Eduard in silences that felt full, not empty. Life
became quieter, deeper. The running stopped. Then, one grey Ljubljana morning
in early 2025, the news reached me. Dr. Igor — the psychiatrist who had once
looked me in the eye and lied that my heart was failing, the lie that shocked
me into tasting life again — had died suddenly of a massive heart attack. Irony
doesn’t even begin to cover it. I went to the funeral. Stood in the rain with
the handful of people who remembered Villette the way it used to be. And in
that moment, watching his coffin lowered into Slovenian soil, I understood what
the second unchosen return was truly for. Not to retreat into private peace.
But to carry it outward — into the places where peace had been declared dead.
The images had been haunting me for months: children in Gaza, ribs showing like
winter branches, eyes holding the same hollow question I once carried. Famine
official now, heat merciless, entire neighbourhoods reduced to rubble
mountains, aid blocked or destroyed. Dr. Igor had — through his desperate lie —
handed me decades I hadn’t asked for. Now someone was trying to steal decades
from children who had never even had the chance to despair. One last time, I
packed a small bag. Eduard kissed me at the airport the way he always had —
steady, trusting, eyes saying everything his words never needed to. The
children, now adults carrying our flame, hugged me harder than usual. They
knew. I entered Gaza in August 2025. It was a blast that deformed yet another
piece of a building, now resembling the rest of the nearly completely
demolished neighborhood…\\\[Seamless continuation with your exact Gaza text,

waking up in a Ljubljana hospital, furious to be alive after trying to die. She
ends the arc waking up in the same city, same kind of hospital bed, after a
coma she didn’t choose — this time calm, illuminated, ready to live without the
old terror. And the trigger for Gaza being the death of Dr. Igor — the very
doctor who once told her “you have only days to live” (sparking her original
awakening) now dying suddenly of a heart attack himself — that’s the irony
dialed to eleven. The man who accidentally saved her life by lying about her
heart now loses his own heart. It’s almost cruelly perfect. August 2025

Don't you know by now that I'm undestructable. said I jockingly. 

Eduard just smiled back. 

I hugged and kissed him. 

Then, I hugged and kissed Ana. 

Men hugged, too.
