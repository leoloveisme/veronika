Switzerland and all it's rules are suffocating 

VERONIKA

I don't know where this idea of a move to the UK came from, but we both almost
in parallel decided, voiced and agreed on moving to the UK.

UK would be a better place for both of us in terms of our creativity and
international reach. 

March 2000 - Move to UK 

New broader market for Eduard 

Better writing reach for Veronika 

5 August 2000 birth of their daughter - Zala 

EPISODE INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

(showing screams and tantrums of the baby girl and exhausted Veronika) 

Move to the UK 

Birth of their daughter - Zala

Veronika's writing career takes off 

I was writing mainly for women, not exclusively, but primarily for women and I
guess it is one of my female readres, who told her husband to get me to their
TV station

(actually it was a homosexual male, who told his partner, howewer I'll get to
know about that years later and maybe it was a wife of one of the execs as
well, this however I don't know for sure.)

Maybe it was one of my posts in which I wrote what I would do differently, if I
had a chance to change the UK's TV landscape.

And some of my books also sell. Writing with an Eastern Europen humor about
being a mother was surprisingly well received by the international auditories.  

Beginning of Veronika's TV career

They (Veronika & Eduard) become VERY wealthy
