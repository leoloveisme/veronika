**Veronika**

Denies vaccination and the danger per se. I don't fear death. I'll when it is
my time to die. 

Following my intuition proved to be very beneficial. Now living outside of a
big city helps me to stay sane. I can swim in the sea all year round, and here
are generally less people that in the big cities. 

**Eduard**

It is not a big deal. Gets vacinnated. 

**Zala **

Strong opponent of vaccination. 

I started to interest myself for sex since I was very young. By the time I was
... I already ... 

I tried it with girls, too, but somehow I like it with men more. 

Zala (late teens/early 20s) in UK uni or gap year. She picks up Spanish fluency
from mom genes + immersion. 

VO (Veronika): "Zala bloomed in the UK like a rose in concrete—friends from
Spain everywhere, and then he appeared: tall, dark-eyed, passionate. My little
rose had her first real flame." Scene: Family dinner, Zala texts in Spanish;
boyfriend calls. Eduard teases: "Who's this 'mi amor'?" Zala blushes, switches
to Spanish with Veronika: "Mamá, es increíble—bailamos salsa toda la noche."
(Mom, he's amazing—we danced salsa all night.) Boyfriend's cultural side:
Passionate, family-oriented (Spanish stereotype), cooks paella for her,
contrasts Eduard's stoic "Matroskin" style. Adds sensuality—echoes mom's
wool-blanket night. The boyfriend could be met via uni/language meetups,
friends, or something else (TBD) By the time pandemic came I was dating a
Spaniard They break up because he is - pro-vaccine and pushy, she's -
contra-vaccine. She leave UK for Mexico and from there when the pandemics are
over travels in Latin America to end up and stay in Colombia. This keeps the
Spanish secret code central (boyfriend speaks it natively, girlfriends
too—double exclusion for men), adds romantic edge without overshadowing themes,
and makes Zala's Colombia run feel earned (seeking that passionate, free life).
During pandemics she is tutoring people English on one of the online tutoring
platforms. She also tries OnlyFans but gives it up. Mexico's "lax" vibe
contrasts UK's cold rules; Zala experiments with freedom there (parties, swims,
perhaps casual flings echoing her high body count past), then matures into
Colombia's purpose-driven phase. 

6 August 2021 - Zala leaves for Mexico 

June 2022: Zala transitions to Colombia (finds purpose as English teacher)

**Luka**

I don't mind. Gets vaccinated. 

Luka and his girlfriend and their story

Luka had some situationships with some of Zala girlfriends (most of them thanks
to Zala) but during pandemics was found by his proper girlfriend on Bumble.
