# Veronika decides to live

The creative space for the book continuation.

The continuation of the story of Veronika and Eduard (“Veronika decides to die”
by Paolo Coelho) where Veronika having lived amazingly beautiful life finds her
death by a drone bombing attempting to save / saving local children in Gaza /
Ukraine.

At the current stage I decided to go with Libre Office for novel because it
enables to create a master document (Markdown doesn't allow / enable (yet) to
do that. I'm working on it on [Crowdly](https://github.com/leoloveisme/crowdly)
) and with Markdown for screenplay, because it is could be used on many platforms inclusive 
[Crowdly](https://github.com/leoloveisme/crowdly)

veronika decides to live.odm - is the main master document of the novel

"chapters" directory which is sub-directory of Novel contains the chapters of
the novel

Currently I'm looking for a co-author for the book: both novel and screenplay

This story could be a branching story - see \[[brainstorming.md]] for Ukraine /
Gaza argument.
