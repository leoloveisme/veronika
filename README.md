# Veronika decides to live

The creative space for the book continuation.

The continuation of the story of Veronika and Eduard (“Veronika decides to die”
by Paolo Coelho) where Veronika having lived amazingly beautiful life finds her
death by a drone bombing attempting to save / saving local children in Gaza /
Ukraine.

At the current stage I decided to go parallel with Libre Office and Crowdly app
for both novel and screenplay because it enables to create a master document. 
[Crowdly](https://github.com/leoloveisme/crowdly)'s master document
functionality is maturing, and currently it is mature enough to be used for
both novels and screenplays. We're actively working on improving formatting in
the [Crowdly](https://github.com/leoloveisme/crowdly) app.

veronika decides to live.odm - is the main master document of the novel written
using Libre Office

"chapters" are sub-directories of the novel which contain, well, the chapters
of the novel

Currently I'm looking for a female co-author for the book: both novel and
screenplay

This story could be a branching story - see brainstorming.md for Ukraine / Gaza
argument.*

\* the argument is currently solved (more information about it in the
brainstorming.md and in the book and book supporting files)
