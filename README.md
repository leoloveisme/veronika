# Veronika decides to live

The creative space for the book continuation.

The continuation of the story of Veronika and Eduard (“Veronika decides to die” by Paolo Coelho) where Veronika having lived amazingly beautiful life finds her death by a drone bombing attempting to save / saving local children in Gaza / Ukraine.

At the current stage I decided to go with Libre Office because it enables to create a master document. 
Markdown doesn't allow / enable (yet) to do that. 

[[veronika decides to live.odm]] - is the main master document of the book

"chapters" directory contains the chapters of the book

Currently I'm looking for a co-author for the book

This story could be a branching story - see [[brainstorming.md]] for Ukraine / Gaza argument.
