dark haired Pisces or Aquarius born at 00:00 20 February (in the night from 19.
February to 20. February) Eduard - very good and internationally commercially
successful painter In socium / society Eduard is rather quiet, however at home
he can be quite a chatterbox at time (this happens to people who are

absolutely is.)

- Dark-haired
- Born: February 20, 00:00 (Pisces/Aquarius cusp)

Eduard was good even in the first book, that the "normal stuff" was boring for
him. (and now when he was doing it as full time activity he polished his
talents into a shiny diamond) His parents knew this however they just left him
searching for what he wanted to find, and what he was looking for was actually
not an abstract concept - it was her - his crazy wife, who he not less crazy,
is in love with. She is hardly there, like sun in Iceland or North Finland /
Lapland during winter and he appreciates ALL the time he can get with her, but
he is not clingy, because he knows that she'll be back (and so do their
children). How long for - that they DO NOT KNOW, and neither does Veronika.

She is yogic He is stoic

like, and this is fucking exhausting.

warm babushka and very cold and very distanced (initially) Veronika II

Babushka: "What is your name?" Veronika II (unvoluntirily, as if making a
favor): "Veronika." Babushka (makes a mental note of her name, just to call her
daughter later asking to bring the "Veronika decides to live" book): And my
name is Martha, Agatha, something else. Veronika (turning her back to babushka
and thinking: "Whatever") and voicing: "Ok"

# Marija

Name: Marija (very Slovene, soft, grandmotherly) Age: 70s. Old enough to have
lived through real shit—maybe she was a nurse during the Yugoslav wars, or lost
family in WWII. She's seen death. She chose life anyway. Why she's in hospital:
routine surgery on shoulder, recovery. She's fine. She's chipper. This makes
Veronika II even more frustrated initially: "How can you be so fucking
cheerful?" Her vibe: Warm but not intrusive. Brings too many blankets. Offers
food from Tupperware her daughter brought. Talks to Veronika II like she's a
grumpy granddaughter, not a suicide risk.

The babushka as bridge:

Generational witness: She's old enough to remember Yugoslavia, war,
displacement, survival. She knows what Veronika II is carrying without needing
to ask. Warm persistence vs. cold withdrawal: The contrast creates tension that
softens over time. Babushka doesn't force connection
