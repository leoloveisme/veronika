Veronika - blond, extremelly good-looking (beauty priviledge)
Eduard - dark haired
Their boy - quiet observer, blond
Their girl - dark-haired 

Eduard was good even in the first book, that the "normal stuff" was boring for him. (and now when he was doing it as full time activity he polished his talents into a shiny diamond) His parents knew this however they just left him searching for what he wanted to find, and what he was looking for was actually not an abstract concept - it was her - his crazy wife, who he not less crazy, is in love with. She is hardly there, like sun in Iceland or North Finland / Lapland during winter and he appreciates ALL the time he can get with her, but he is not clingy, because he knows that she'll be back (and so do their children). How long for - that they DO NOT KNOW, and neither does Veronika.

She is yogic
He is stoic
