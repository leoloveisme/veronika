# Eduard 
dark haired
Pisces or Aquarius
born at 00:00 20 February (in the night from 19. February to 20. February)
Eduard - very good and internationally commercially successful painter
In socium / society Eduard is rather quiet, however at home he can be quite a chatterbox at time (this happens to people who are introverted and feel secure and in a trustworthy environment, which his family absolutely is.)

Their boy - quiet observer, blond
February 1999 - boy is born
The older boy: quiet, good sleeper from birth.
he’s the one who sits still for hours drawing or listening to music, the “easy” child who doesn’t demand much but observes everything.


Their girl - dark-haired 
August 2000 - girl is born
Their girl - dark-haired
The younger daughter: rebellious, sleepless as a baby.
She’s clearly inherited Veronika’s fire—the restlessness, the refusal to conform, the need to feel everything intensely.
Picture toddler; her screaming through the night while Veronika, half-exhausted, half-thrilled, thinks: This is what aliveness feels like, and this is fucking exhausting.


Eduard was good even in the first book, that the "normal stuff" was boring for him. (and now when he was doing it as full time activity he polished his talents into a shiny diamond) His parents knew this however they just left him searching for what he wanted to find, and what he was looking for was actually not an abstract concept - it was her - his crazy wife, who he not less crazy, is in love with. She is hardly there, like sun in Iceland or North Finland / Lapland during winter and he appreciates ALL the time he can get with her, but he is not clingy, because he knows that she'll be back (and so do their children). How long for - that they DO NOT KNOW, and neither does Veronika.

She is yogic
He is stoic
