North Thailand (mountain regions).
Decision to “become friends with cold” despite tropical latitude — internal paradox established.

Cold formalized as philosophy; nature as teacher rather than adversary.

2009–2011
United States.
Fragmented stays; contrast between excess, speed, and inner emptiness.

2012–2015
Latin America (multiple countries).
Slow time, body knowledge, ritual, and earth-based healing traditions.
