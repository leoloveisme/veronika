# Brainstorming space for the book's story (characters, locations, etc)

How many children? Gender of the children, etc...

Once the breast-feading phase was finished the children were in the custody of Edward and the grandparents on both sides. 

Gardening and planting wherever she was

Spiritual places 

yoga

Auyasca - somewhere Amazonia

and other experiences in this direction

## Auroville

poisonous bite (insect? / snake?) - "run" for life - scar (where?)

I decided to go with viper bite because they are quite critical and when one delays the time to get into hospital and get an immediate help in may cause complications and that why Veronika will end up in coma

Now I / we need to decide on location where the bite would happen and the time (how long) she spent in coma

I think India and Auroville in particular fit the story well. 

a. because I'd love to promote the original Auroville cause 
and 
b. Auroville is advanced enough to provide at least initial help

## Ice bathing

## Iceland



Short love affairs (?)

Edward - very good and internationally commercially successful painter

They lived a "crazy" life "crazy" loving each other

I want people to weep when they finish reading the book and jump from their butts and go into the world and change it to their best capacity.
