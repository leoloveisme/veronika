# Brainstorming space for the book's story (characters, locations, etc)


This person below is the inspiration for Eduard

Wilhelm Sasnal was born on December 29, 1972, in Tarnów, Poland, and currently lives and works in Kraków.  He is married to Anka Sasnal, a collaborator with whom he has co-created several films, including It Looks Better From a Distance (2011) and The Assistant (2024).  The couple has a son, Kacper, whose birth and early life were documented in Sasnal’s 2001 comic book Życie codzienne w Polsce (Everyday Life in Poland), a semi-autobiographical work reflecting on family, personal milestones, and post-communist Polish society. 

Sasnal’s personal life is deeply interwoven with his artistic practice, as he frequently draws from intimate moments—family snapshots, domestic scenes, and personal memories—transforming them into broader reflections on identity, history, and collective memory. His work often explores emotional distance and ambiguity, using titles to reveal personal connections to otherwise neutral or media-sourced imagery.

Veronika prototypes

Tanja Starič is a Slovenian journalist, presenter of the show Echoes on RTV Slovenia and editor. She was born on April 2, 1962 in Novi Mesto.

Family: She is closely related to a family that has a strong connection to journalism. Her mother lives in a home for the elderly, where she visits at least once a week. Her partner, Miha, is also a journalist, so they understand professional stress and unpredictable schedules.
Son: Their only son studied in Prague and Paris as part of the Erasmus program, currently lives in Ljubljana and majors in economics. The old woman mentioned that it was difficult when her son left home, but they survived the turning point with a new, friendly relationship without a child.
Lifestyle: Lives in Ljubljana, where he is renovating his grandmother's house. He attends tourist and cultural events, especially with an interest in sports, especially football, and is a big fan of Arsenal.
Interesting facts: Her personal life is not connected with the scandal, which, according to her, is the reason why she is not interesting on the Internet. She mentions that she led a "road trip" through the Balkans with her partner, which was important for maintaining the relationship after the child left.
Starič also appears as a co-author of the podcast The Art of the Possible with Aleš Kocjan.

Brexit occurred on 31 January 2020, when the United Kingdom officially left the European Union.  The withdrawal took effect at 11:00 PM GMT (midnight CET), marking the end of the UK's 47-year membership in the EU. This followed a referendum held on 23 June 2016, in which voters chose to leave the bloc by a margin of 51.9% to 48.1%.  The formal process began on 29 March 2017 when Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. After multiple delays and political challenges, a withdrawal agreement was ratified by the UK Parliament, leading to the UK's departure. A transition period then began, ending on 31 December 2020, after which the UK fully exited the EU single market and customs union. 


Impact of Brexit on EU Citizens Already Living in the UK
EU citizens who were already residing in the UK by 11:00 PM on 31 December 2020 had their rights protected under the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.  However, they were required to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) to secure their status and continue living in the UK. 

1. EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)
Settled Status: Granted to those who had lived in the UK continuously for at least five years. It is equivalent to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), allowing indefinite residence, work, study, and access to public services. 
Pre-Settled Status: Given to those who had not yet completed five years of continuous residence. This status is valid for five years, during which time individuals can accumulate the required residence period to apply for settled status. 

2. Rights and Benefits
Holders of settled or pre-settled status retain the right to:

Work and study in the UK
Access healthcare (NHS), pensions, and public funds (if eligible)
Rent property
Apply for British citizenship (after meeting additional requirements) 

3. Family Members
Close family members (spouses, children, dependent parents) who were in the UK by the deadline could apply under the scheme.
Family members joining later must prove their relationship existed by 31 December 2020. 
Children born or adopted after this date are also protected under the scheme.

4. Travel and Documentation
Status is held digitally; no physical proof is issued unless requested or required (e.g., non-EU family members). 
A share code can be generated to verify status with employers or landlords. 
Travel in and out of the UK is permitted, but settled status may be lost after five continuous years abroad (four years for Swiss citizens). 



## Eduard

was able to make friends with major gallery owners and was regularly exhibited
in 2 other major metropoles besides London - in New York and Berlin. 

Sometimes his paintings were just shipped there and sometimes he personally
accompanied them. 

It ALL depended on the requests of the gallery owners. 

When he went to Berlin, he also usually went to Lubljana to visit his parents

**Additional input after using Milanote visual boards**

I created a Screenplay directory and placed it there

- - -
Eduard - I do it for our children's sake Luka - it's not a big deal (I don't
believe it, too, but I do it nevertheless - convenience) Zala - fuck NO, it ALL
is just a hoax Veronika - I don't fear it und honestly also like Zala do not
believe it

Fear kills - we ALL as a family do NOT fret in each family member own way

Her son (the quiet one) has started a foundation funding humanitarian aid
workers in conflict zones—named after his mother

Your cold water swim series has changed my life. 

"What out. Don't move." suddenly said Veronika to the videographer. "There is a
snake behind you. DON'T MOVE."

She picked a stick from the ground and tried to scare the snake away. And some
other snake might have crawled away, not viper though. It jumed to attack
Veronika and bit her into the left leg. 

Veronika: "It's fucking unfair what Israeli government is doing in Gaza. I'll
go there to see whether I can turn the things around somehow... for everyone,
for humanity, for my sense of satisfaction... I went there and I did it"

(she doesn't know that yet that it will turn out into - "I went there and I did
what I could..." and then this rocket like a comet would take her life and of
other beings and leave additional destruction and that is pretty much which she
would've achieved, at least on paper, however people who would have read the
whole book would weep exactly because of that because they couldn't see this
active and still full of energy woman being able to realize her FULL POTENTIAL
which she could've done - and currently I don't really know how to achieve
that; and the second objective which I want to have achieved with the book is
that people jump off their butt and go into the world changing it for better -
leave the place where(ever) you currently are better than you have found it,
doing everything you can with everything you have available, while also
changing yourself, educating yourself constantly and continuously...)

The trigger for Gaza move is the death of Dr. Igor and her personal thoughts on
uncertainty - "how much time do I still left...?"

Veronika: "I made myself busy to just live a busy life so the thoughts I had
prior Vilette won't get to me more often than they should - what is it ALL
for???"

Now let's build the meat around that trigger: The psychological arc you need to
flesh out:

Early chapters (post-Villete through ~2020): She's running from numbness
through intensity—ice swims, travel, yoga, sex, risk. It's all reactive. She's
proving the suicide attempt wrong by collecting extreme experiences like
trophies. Middle section (~2020-2024): The cracks start showing. The kids are
adults now. Eduard is successful. She's achieved the "full life"... but the
original question is creeping back: "What is it ALL for?" The busyness isn't
working anymore. Dr. Igor's death (early 2025): The man who "gave" her life
(via the fake heart condition lie) dies of an actual heart attack. The irony is
unbearable. She realizes: he gave her time, but she still hasn't answered the
question he forced her to confront—what is life FOR? Auroville coma (Jan-April
2025): She survives again—but this time it feels less like a miracle and more
like a debt. How many times can she be saved while others aren't? The viper
didn't kill her. The pills didn't kill her. But Dr. Igor is dead. Children in
Gaza are dead. Survivors' guilt transforms into survivors' responsibility.
Return to Slovenia (May-July 2025): Recovery. She's physically weak but
mentally crystallizing. She sees her adult children thriving. Eduard's art is
globally celebrated. Her books/TV work reached millions. She built a full life.
But it's not enough. Because she's been living for herself this whole time—even
the altruism (gardens, yoga, travel docs) was ultimately about her feeling
alive. Decision (July 2025): The thought: "I have maybe 10, 20, 30 years left.
Or maybe 10 days. Dr. Igor didn't know. I don't know. But I know right now
children are dying in Gaza while I'm safe in Slovenia. If I'm going to decide
to live, I have to decide to live for them too—not just for my own intensity."
Gaza (August 2025): Not a death wish. Not even purely heroic. It's the final
answer to Villete's question: Life is for using what you've been given (time,
privilege, survival) to protect life where it's most threatened. She's not
running from numbness anymore—she's running toward meaning.

Chapters 15-18 (roughly 2020-2025) need these scenes:

Dr. Igor's funeral—she stands at the grave, remembering Villete, realizing he's
gone but she's still here asking the same question.

In the coma—fever dreams where she sees Dr. Igor, Eduard, her children, the boy
in Gaza she hasn't met yet but somehow knows is there. A conversation with
Eduard after she wakes up where he knows she's changed. Maybe he asks: "You're
planning on going somewhere, again, aren't you?" And she can't lie to him. "You
lived ALL your without fear. So why are you afraid now?" Veronika is afraid of
dying without having lived for something beyond herself.

Veronika ends up in Gaza because she heard that her TV channel wants go do a
documentary about Gaza, and as a result she goes there to make yet another
documentary. 

She and her videographer are smuggled into Gaza, because Israeli military
doesn't let foreigners inside of Gaza region.

When they were done filming and the videographer started to pack the equipment,
he turned his back to Veronika and didn't that she was gone. 

Then he heard the rocket exploded... and so he found out that Veronika died in
this explotion. 

- - -
Some stuff to work with after a conversation with Grok 

My huge issue is - how to distill / condense 2 enormous universes to a small
bright comet ??? It is an (almost) impossible task. 

Eduard was good even in the first book, that the "normal stuff" was boring for
him. (and now when he was doing it as full time activity he polished his
talents into a shiny diamond) His parents knew this however they just left him
searching for what he wanted to find, and what he was looking for was actually
not an abstract concept - it was her - his crazy wife, who he not less crazy,
is in love with. She is hardly there, like sun in Iceland or North Finland /
Lapland during winter and he appreciates ALL the time he can get with her, but
he is not clingy, because he knows that she'll be back (and so do their
children). How long for - that they DO NOT KNOW, and neither does Veronika.

She is yogic He is stoic

In Coelho’s book: she decides to die → lives. In mine: she decides to live
(fiercely, repeatedly, defiantly) → dies.

the cold is something to feel alive and yoga and meditation is something to
clear head - these are just the tools to get live more or less under control -
for Veronika and stoicism - for Eduard. I'm still looking for the central
theme... She decides to live but what for???

She decides to live… but what for? The outer answer is easy: travel, writing,
kids, ice swims, yoga, breathwork, TV fame, Gaza. Tools to feel alive, to clear
the head, to keep the numbness at bay.But the real answer — the one that glues
the whole comet together — has to be deeper than “to feel alive.” Because
“feeling alive” is the method, not the purpose.Let’s hunt for the central theme
by asking what Veronika is actually chasing, underneath all the intensity.From
everything you’ve shared, here are the strongest contenders for what her life
is ultimately FOR:

To prove — every single day — that her original suicide attempt was wrong. Not
just “life is worth living,” but a fierce, almost vengeful demonstration: “I
was wrong to try to leave. Look how much there is. Look how much I would have
missed.” Every extreme experience, every child, every risk is evidence in her
private trial against the old Veronika who wanted out.

To redeem the life she almost threw away by giving it away to others. The arc
ends in Gaza not as a death wish, but as the logical endpoint: once she learns
how precious her own life is, she can’t sit comfortably while others have
theirs stolen. Choosing life ultimately means choosing it for everyone —
especially where it’s most threatened.

To pass on the miracle she was forcibly given. She didn’t choose to survive the
pills — the universe (or fate, or medicine) shoved life back into her hands.
Now she has to justify that unasked-for gift by living so fully that the
miracle feels earned. And by teaching her children (and later strangers in war
zones) the same ferocious gratitude.

To love so intensely that even absence becomes a form of presence. With Eduard
and the kids as the steady centre, her wandering isn’t escape — it’s the only
way she knows to love without suffocating them or herself. She decides to live
for them, but in the only shape she can manage: coming back brighter, sharper,
more alive each time, like a comet that keeps returning to its sun.

To answer the question she asked in the asylum: “What is the point of all
this?” The original book ends with a kind of mystical shrug. Your version
spends a lifetime refusing to shrug. The point isn’t found in one epiphany —
it’s built, brick by brick, child by child, risk by risk, until the final Gaza
scene becomes her lived answer.

Closes the physical and emotional circle: Ljubljana hospital → Ljubljana
hospital. Makes Dr. Igor’s death the intimate, personal trigger — not just
news, but legacy and debt. Keeps the irony razor-sharp: she decides to live →
dies; the doctor who “gave” her life by inventing her heart condition loses his
own heart. Frames Gaza as the deliberate final act of gratitude and solidarity
— paying forward the unchosen gift.

The comet burns brightest at the very end.

- - -
I wonder what to do with Dr. Igor? Do we need him in the story. Now when he is
old, do we need to bring them: Veronika and him for a conversation? What their
conversation would be about?

- - -
Both children are in Lubljana for girl's birthday. 

Mom's calling.

MOM is displayed on the telephone screen. 

Hi, mom. Darling, do you remember Dr. Igor? Of course, I do. What about him?
Well, he actually died of a heart attack, yesterday.

Burial ceremony. Veronika with Eduard and children are there, too. 

- - -
I also initially wanted to display parting from the loved one (death of parents
of each side) - actually I'm not sure (about that) now.

- - -
Bringing Eduard and the two children into her life transforms the original
ending—where everything is open, fragile, and almost mythical—into something
more human, enduring, and real.

the love between Veronika and Eduard is intense but silent: she plays the piano
to reach him through his schizophrenia, he paints visions for her, they make
love under the stars, and then she “escapes” the asylum (and supposedly her
impending death). 

The children sound perfectly contrasted and very alive already:The older boy:
quiet, good sleeper from birth. He almost feels like an echo of
Eduard—introspective, perhaps carrying some of that same inward, artistic
depth. Maybe he’s the one who sits still for hours drawing or listening to
music, the “easy” child who doesn’t demand much but observes everything. The
younger daughter: rebellious, sleepless as a baby. She’s clearly inherited
Veronika’s fire—the restlessness, the refusal to conform, the need to feel
everything intensely. I can already picture toddler; her screaming through the
night while Veronika, half-exhausted, half-thrilled, thinks: This is what
aliveness feels like, and this is fucking exhausting. This is what I almost
threw away.

Now it’s not just about her own life and death wish turned life wish. It’s
about responsibility. What if something goes wrong? Who would raise those two
very different children? How would Eduard—still perhaps fragile in his own
way—cope? Does she feel guilt as she stands at the edge of the water? Or does
she feel that this extreme act is necessary precisely because she’s a mother
now—because domestic life, love, routine sometimes threaten to numb her again,
and she needs the shock of near-freezing water to remember she’s still the
woman who once swallowed pills and then chose the opposite?

What I'm thinking about is - the book ends in 1998 They marry the same year
Next year (1999) they have their first Almost at the end of the year 2000 they
have their second (Love making feels so good; They are really deep into each
other on all possible levels) In socium / society Eduard is rather quiet,
however at home he can be quite a chatterbox at time (this happens to people
who are introverted and feel secure and in a trustworthy environment, which his
family absolutely is.) In 2004 - Slovenia joins EU Because Veronika will go to
India (and this even several times) my considerations are to send her for her
first time in India with the first child or alone later 

I wonder how easy it was for Slovenians to get into India in the time before
2004?

marrying Eduard in 1998 right as the original story wraps, the first child (the
quiet boy) arriving in 1999 amid the Y2K buildup, and the second (fiery
daughter) conceived in a moment of deep, all-encompassing intimacy at the end
of 2000, born early 2001. It grounds their "mad" love from Villete in something
profoundly ordinary yet sacred: family rhythms, Eduard's selective chattiness
blooming at home (yes, spot-on for introverts in safe spaces), and the EU
accession in 2004 marking a subtle shift in their world's borders and
opportunities.Now, on Veronika's trips to India: Sending her alone later (say,
post-2001 when the kids are a bit older) feels narratively potent—it could be
her reclaiming solo adventure amid motherhood's demands, perhaps triggered by a
restlessness that echoes her pre-Villete numbness but now channeled into
spiritual seeking (Ashrams? Yoga? The Ganges as a cold-water parallel?). Taking
the first child (the boy, with his quiet nature) on the inaugural trip could
add tender layers: his calm observing her plunge into the unknown, mirroring
how she once reached Eduard through music. Either way, it ties beautifully into
the ice-swimming motif—India's heat and chaos as a contrasting "extremity" to
Scandinavia's freeze.

Ease of Travel from Slovenia to India Pre-2004 Based on historical diplomatic
and visa records, it was feasible and relatively straightforward for Slovenian
citizens to obtain an Indian tourist visa in the late 1990s to early 2000s, but
not effortless by modern standards. Slovenia's post-independence stability
(recognized by India in 1992, full diplomatic ties by mid-1992) meant no
special hurdles tied to its Yugoslav past—Slovenian passports were treated like
other European ones. However, without e-visas (introduced only in 2014) or
visa-on-arrival for Slovenians, it required proactive planning, paperwork, and
likely a day trip abroad. Here's a breakdown:Visa Type and ProcessRequired
Visa: Tourist visa (single or multiple entry, typically 3-6 months validity,
allowing 15-30 days per stay initially; extensions possible in India). No
visa-free entry or on-arrival for Slovenians then (or now, for ordinary
passports). Application Location: No Indian embassy in Slovenia until February
2007, so applications went through the Indian Embassy in Vienna, Austria (about
380 km/4-5 hour drive from Ljubljana, or a cheap flight/train). Vienna handled
Central European jurisdictions including Slovenia, Croatia, and Hungary at the
time. Some used the Indian High Commission in London if traveling there, but
Vienna was the default for Central Europeans. How to Apply:In Person or Mail:
Submit at the Vienna embassy's consular section (open weekdays). No online
forms—everything paper-based. Processing Time: 3-7 working days typically;
expedited options rare but possible for a fee. Cost: Around €20-50 (or
equivalent in USD/Schilling pre-euro), paid in cash or bank draft. Fees were
reciprocal and low for Europeans.

Documents Needed (standard for a solo adult or with child):Valid Slovenian
passport (at least 6 months beyond planned stay, 2 blank pages). Completed visa
application form (2 copies; downloadable from embassy or picked up there). 2
recent passport photos (35x45mm, white background). Proof of itinerary:
Round-trip flight bookings, hotel reservations, or tour plan. Financial proof:
Bank statement showing ~€50/day of stay, or sponsor letter if applicable. For
travel with child (e.g., the boy): Birth certificate, parental consent if solo
parent, child's passport. No interview usually, but embassy could request one
for longer stays.

Success Rate/Challenges: High approval rate (~95%+) for genuine tourists from
stable countries like Slovenia—no political tensions or terrorism links.
Rejections were rare but for incomplete docs or suspicious intent (e.g.,
overland "hippie trail" vibes without clear return plans). Post-9/11 (2001),
scrutiny ticked up slightly for all Westerners, but not drastically for
Europeans.

Travel Logistics from SloveniaFlights: Direct-ish routes were limited; typical
path: Ljubljana to Vienna/Frankfurt/Munich, then to Delhi/Mumbai (e.g., via
Lufthansa or Austrian Airlines, 10-14 hours total, €500-800 round-trip). No
low-cost carriers like today. With a Child: Doable but logistically
heavier—extra docs for the kid, potential childcare for the daughter back home.
Air India or European carriers had family-friendly policies, but long-haul with
a toddler meant jetlag battles. Overall Ease Rating: On a scale of 1-10 (10
being passport-stamp easy), it'd be a 6-7. Comparable to other Europeans (e.g.,
Austrians or Germans), but the Vienna trek added friction. For a determined
Veronika (post-Villete firebrand), it'd be a minor quest—perhaps even symbolic
of breaking borders. By 2004 (EU entry), nothing changed visa-wise for India,
but Schengen eased intra-Europe travel, making Vienna visits simpler.

If you go with the solo trip (say, 2002-2003), it could highlight her
independence; with the boy (maybe 2001, when he's ~2), it adds vulnerability
and bonding. Either fits the "deciding to live" theme—India as her next
"plunge."What draws her to India specifically? Spiritual reset, or something
tied to Eduard's art/schizophrenia recovery? Share more timeline beats if you
want help fleshing them out! 

If you want her first India trip around 2002-2003 (kids 3-4 and 1-2 years old),
it feels like peak restlessness: family life is stable and loving, but she
needs that far-edge contrast to the cold waters. **India as the opposite
extreme—scorching, chaotic, spiritually overwhelming.**

Think about it: this is the woman who, pre-Villete, was so numb she tried to
end it all. Post-Villete (and post-marriage/kids in your version), she's
reborn—craving intensity to prove she's truly alive. Ice swimming alone in
Iceland? That's her jamming a finger into the socket of existence. 

shall I make an abortion? No one would know about that What stops her from
having that abortion?

VO (in Veronika voice) shall I make an abortion? No one would know about that
What stops her from having that abortion? Dilemma VO (in Veronika voice) I
almost killed myself once... How can I cancel the life which doesn't belong to
me? Should I not live that decision to the child?

She tells Eduard about being pregnant later (on Skype)

Historical Slovenian-Indian relations (parents of Eduard - ambassador family)

**Change the world in your capacity**

The weep factor: Build the final chapters with letters/home videos to Eduard
and the kids (now ~26 boy, ~24 girl—adults reflecting her/ his traits),
flashbacks to Villete piano, Iceland plunge, family passions, Tsoy lyrics. She
knows the risk but goes anyway: "Madness or bravery? This time, for them."
Readers finish devastated—her "deciding to live" ultimately means dying so
others might—but inspired to act, as you want.Eduard’s reaction: His paintings
become global memorials; kids carry on her gardens/altruism. End with return to
Slovenia for burial, but her spirit in Gaza's survivors.This lands like a
thunderbolt—tragic, timely, transformative. If you want scene ideas, exact date
(e.g., during Storm Byron floods for symbolism), or how to weave in
genocide/terrorism themes without preaching, let's flesh it.

Notes on Structure (for later deep dive)

Cold appears three times: Thailand (decision) → Ice swimming (practice) →
Iceland (integration)

India frames the story: departure (1999) and return (2024–2025)

Iceland sits best after initial ice swimming, not before

Latin America works best before the final return to India, as an expansion
before collapse

- - -
IMPORTANT!!!! Ask for usage of the real names of people mentioned in the book. 

I've chosen to live again and again over the years

Eduard seems to have found money glitch in the system, however his paintings
are selling and they are selling fast and with that growth his selebrity
marking. 

## [Timeline of the book](timeline.md)

Feel free to move or shuffle the timeline and / or the events, if you think it

feeblemindedness and bravery / courage / daring - слабоумие и отвага 

To grow even futher and complete this overcoming of the fear for water, she
will go swimming in the cold waters in Iceland

Gardening and planting wherever she was

multilingual

learned Spanish, Portuguese, Tamil, and even some Icelandic

and English, German, Italian, French and some Russian she already knew / could
speak and understand 

Spiritual places 

yoga

Auyasca - somewhere Amazonia

and other experiences in this direction

## Auroville

poisonous bite (viper - agressive and attacking) - "run" for life - scar (leg)

I decided to go with viper bite because they are quite critical and when one
delays the time to get into hospital and get an immediate help in may cause
complications and that why Veronika will end up in coma

Now I / we need to decide on location where the bite would happen (Auroville)
and the time she spent in coma (3 months)

I think India and Auroville in particular fit the story well:

a. because I'd love to promote the original Auroville cause 

and

b. Auroville is advanced enough to provide at least initial help

## Ice bathing

Training with Wim Hoff

## Iceland

During her time in Gaza she was quickly acquiring Arabic and Hebrew.

I decided to go with Gaza story instead of Ukraine one. 

People who want to develop the Ukrainian branch of the story feel free to
branch the story and finish it there. 

Genocide and terrorism - we need to look into this in the book as well 

AI could potentially help us to prosper and instead of this we train it how to
kill people (drones and drones attacks)

Short love affairs (?)

Eduard - very good and internationally commercially successful painter

They lived a "crazy" life "crazy" loving each other

Relationship anarchy

"Кто живёт по законам другим и кому умирать молодым" В. Цой / "The ones who
live by other laws and who are destined to die young" V. Tsoy

I want people to weep when they finish reading the book and jump from their
butts and go into the world and change it to their best capacity.

## Traveling

Shall she travel with the first newborn child? Will she travel with the first
newborn child? Where will she go first? India.

Boy (older more loved by Veronika) and girl (younger more loved by Eduard)

Boy was quiet and a good "sleeper" - blond hair 

Girl opposite of the boy (not quiet and not a good sleeper) - black hair

Once the breast-feeding phase was finished the children were in the custody of
Eduard and the grandparents on both sides. 

When the children will be off the breastfeeding she will travel alone and the
children will stay with her and / or at times with Eduard's parents, but mostly
with her parents. 

Eduard will travel quite a lot himself with his painting exhibitions. 

When you can sleep 8 hours you wake up fresh and ready to deal with everything
the world has on offer for you that day, however when you don't sleep enough or
at all everything falls difficult and nearly impossible.
