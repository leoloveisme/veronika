# Brainstorming space for the book's story (characters, locations, etc)


Did they move to another country?

Which one?

Did they move several times?

Where to?


## Time line of the book

When? 
Where?
Why?


To show the growth and overcoming of the fear for water, because she will go swimming in the cold waters in Iceland ?


Gardening and planting wherever she was

multilingual

learned Spanish, Portuguese, Tamil, Icelandic

and English, German, Italian and French she already could

Spiritual places 

yoga

Auyasca - somewhere Amazonia

and other experiences in this direction

## Auroville

poisonous bite (insect? / snake?) - "run" for life - scar (where?)

I decided to go with viper bite because they are quite critical and when one delays the time to get into hospital and get an immediate help in may cause complications and that why Veronika will end up in coma

Now I / we need to decide on location where the bite would happen and the time (how long) she spent in coma

I think India and Auroville in particular fit the story well. 

a. because I'd love to promote the original Auroville cause 

and
 
b. Auroville is advanced enough to provide at least initial help

## Ice bathing

## Iceland


During her time in Gaza she was quickly acquiring Arabic and Hebrew.

I decided to go with Gaza story instead of Ukraine one. 

People who want to develop the Ukrainian branch of the story feel free to branch the story and finish it there. 


Genocide and terrorism - we need to look into this in the book as well 


Short love affairs (?)

Eduard - very good and internationally commercially successful painter

They lived a "crazy" life "crazy" loving each other

"Кто живёт по законам другим и кому умирать молодым" В. Цой / "The ones who live by other laws and who are destined to die young" V. Tsoy

I want people to weep when they finish reading the book and jump from their butts and go into the world and change it to their best capacity.

## Traveling

Shall she travel with the first newborn child? Will she travel with the first newborn child?
Where will she go first?

How many children? Gender of the children, etc...

Boy (older more loved by Veronika) and girl (younger more loved by Eduard)

Boy was quiet and a good "sleeper" - blond hair 
Girl opposite of the boy (not quiet and not a good sleeper) - black hair

Once the breast-feeding phase was finished the children were in the custody of Eduard and the grandparents on both sides. 

When the second child will be born she'll travel ... who with? how? where?

When the children will be off the breastfeeding she will travel alone and the children will stay with her and / or at times with Eduard's parents, but mostly with her parents. 

Eduard will travel quite a lot himself with his painting exhibitions. 

When you can sleep 8 hours you wake up fresh and ready to deal with everything the world has on offer for you that day, however when you don't sleep enough or at all everything falls difficult and nearly impossible.
