# Intro

I really loved “Veronika decides to die” and once I finished reading the book I
had several thoughts: 

1\. the book is too short 

2\. the story isn’t finished 

That’s why I decided to write this book. 

Munich, November 2025

## Apocalypse now

Gaza, August 2025

Drone in the sky above Gaza

(Camera follows a rocket leaving fiery trail in the sky and flying towards a
building and crashing into it) 

EXT - on street in Gaza - Day 

(devastation - partially or fully demolished building - heat and smoke) 

It was a blast that deformed yet another piece of a building, now resembling
the rest of the nearly completely demolished neighborhood… 

War is a heartless machine, a creation of politicians. It takes no precautions
and differentiates nothing among beings: be it a cat, a dog, a child, or a
grown-up. 

Heat and destruction are bad partners; add dust and smoke, and you have a
nearly apocalyptic premise laid out right before our eyes. 

# Life goes on

Lubljana, 16 April 1998

“What”s going on?” asked Veronika. 

“Nothing,” said Eduard, helping her to her feet. “Or rather a miracle happened:
another day of life.” (original version from the book / “Or actually
everything. You're alive. Tell me, how amazing is that?” (my version) 

\- “Well, that sucks.” - “Ha, ha, ha” 

\- “What shall we do next?” 

\- “Let’s get married and have children” jokingly said Eduard. 

\- “I think it’s a good idea. Let’s get married. Even if I die tomorrow, I’ll
die as a married woman. Not that actually matters.” And she laughed. 

Eduard joined and laughed, too.

Eduard's paintings "sudenly" starting to sell(his influential parents pulled
the strings) 

Infinite money glitch happened / discovered 

Eduard is very down to Earth and knows / assumes / has a hunch that the money
glitch won't be forever 

His parents influence in Eduard's money savvy-ness (Matroskin cat mentality -

Veronika starts writing

# What’s next?

The time since our escape from the “mad house” and our marriage just flew: 

There was so much change in the world and me becoming pregnant with our first
child also somewhat contributed to that too, then the second child was born as
well and somehow after all these sleepless days and nights and you experiencing
the reality as if in the haze also contributed to The fall of the Berlin wall
opened and the collapse of the Soviet Union has started new era of life. 

Shortly after Slovenia became it’s own country and became independent. 

Due to my looks (both males and females found me extremely attractive) and
hopefuly to my brains it was quite easy to become an new anchor on the
Slovenian TV and later on one of the major UK TV channels and I was quite a
decent writer, too. Writing fell easy for me and I felt that I was good at
words; both written and spoken. Strangelly enough words appeared in my head as
by themselves flying in quickly like commets with their cosmic speed.

My children ended up seeing me more on the TV screen than at home

When you give birth to a child or more than one you're kind of expected to know
everything. At least this is the expectation the world places on you. And it is
quite dishearthening to know that this expection / these expectations are far
far away, thousands upon thousands miles away from the reality you live day
after day after day. Just imagine the mountain Everest of expectations placed
onto the fragile shoulders of underage mothers. Technically I wasn’t underage,
however from the general ripeness I was also quite far. 

\**January 1999 **

\**Move to Switzerland, Bern **

(Eduard's paintings are suddenly selling there)

\**February 1999 **

**Birth of the boy**

And even though I was not underage when I gave birth to our first child, I
still was very far from being perfect person and perfect mother. 

Veronika's writing career takes off

They (Veronika & Eduard) become VERY wealthy

What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger...

Once one gets bitten by “travel bug” one gets it running for quite a long while
/ time and some never get off it.Seeing other countries and experiencing other
cultures, beautiful architecture and bright vibrant clothes of the south,
eating tasty foods and fruits.All this makes us wanting more: other countries,
other foods and fruits, other clothes and different architecture. However I
didn’t know all this at the time of me preparing for my very first trip to
India. India is one of the countries, which has very different architecture,
from Mogul inspired to French, tasty fruits and nasty monkeys and crows, which
will steal your food, at any given opportunity. 

A bureaucratic hassle like driving/train/flight to Vienna for an Indian visa? 

Peanuts, even with the baby. (birth cert, consent if Eduard stays home), but
totally doable. 

Long-haul flight with a toddler is the real grind, not the visa.

BACK in Bern

INT - Bedroom - NIGHT

After she has packed everything and put boy to bed, she set up the baby
phoneand went to / came into Eduard's studio.... 

She knew that she has got at least 2 - 3 hours before she would need to feedthe
boy... 

VO (*in Veronika voice)*

Normal women, who breastfeed usually lose their libido during the
breastfeedingtime - not me though, my libido has actually become amplified

INT - EDUARD'S STUDIO ROOM - NIGHT

Veronika enters the studio with a thick wool blanket over her shoulder 

She kissed Eduard 

Steps away and spreads out the blanket on the floor while 

Eduard is amusedand in bewilderment watches what Veronika is doing (she acted
weirdly the whole day long today)

She half lies down onto theblanket and waves with the hand to Eduard to come
(come, come)

The whole day she was preparing herself for this - she rubbed herself against
him like a horny cat in May - in the kitchen, in his studio - when she came to
call him for lunch and dinner to his bewilderment keeping him thinking what
isactually going on today :) 

When he came to the blanket and copied her pose she pressed him onto his
shoulders, him ending up lying on his back and ... she kissed and rode him, she
rode and kissed him very well that night. 

In the morning Eduard drives them to the airport. 

They kiss and she waves goodbye, after having entered the gate. 

## India

When I was a child I was drowning once and even though I was rescued timely -
and later into the years I learned how to swim - respect for water remained,
that why when an old Gypsy woman told her once that I will die of drowning it
even emphasized the cocktail of fear and respect for water together. These
words of this old Gypsy woman, you can say, remained stuck with her, and became
deeply ingrained into her. I always was and is very cautions when entering
water and when I was in water. That why I was not very thrilled about when I
was invited to drive or go swimming, especially in somewhat dangerous
unsupervised waters like sea or even more cautions when it was about an ocean,
like it was here in India. 

**Varkala**

some persistent interest from a male over several days

He was very well behaved and extremely polite ALL the fucking time and this
appauled me and on the other hand made him etremely attractive for me. 

I was returning from my yoga session in the morning and even though it was
morning it was already very hot. When I was returning from the yoga session for
mothers - there were all kind of women there: Russian, Indian, Australian and
me; I was not in my best shape and yet he has overshowered me with compliments
for how beautiful I am and how great I look. I met a guy, who besides showering
me with compliments every time he saw me, even when I didn’t look very
appealing, not that I cared. 

He gave me some books to read 

He invited me into one of the local restaurants we had a lunch, spoke about
pretty much under sun. I told him about the books I was reading and he was
telling me about the books he was reading and in return I exchanged a couple of
books, which I already read at the local book shop and gave him two books as a
gift, because he told me that he haven’t read them yet: 

“Shantaram” - story of love, friendship and war and “Fine Balance” - a very
depressing one and nevertheless quite accurately depicting India as it was
before, which in turn helps one to grasp / understand why it is still the way
it is now. 

Next day our paths have crossed again. Was he stocking me? And he invited me to
another restaurant. The restaurant was overlooking ocean and I as usually ate
while I breastfed my boyThe conversation was light and flew easily and
unconstrained. Once we were done, he walked us to our hotel and I invited him
to come to the room

In the room I put the boy to bed and he came to me and kissed me

He started gently undress her

I played with his hair

sudden vomit reaction (Veronika)

and I vomitted directly onto him

I apologized and run into the bathroom

The guy remained staying speechless for some time and then just left

When I came out – he has already left. 

(the male being a gentlemen leaves while I is still in the bathroom)

(Emotional breakdown)

(so I discovered / became aware that I am pregnant)

Fuck, I’m pregnant, again.

Finding out that I was pregnant was an interesting surprise. 

EXT - Outside of the hotel - NEXT DAY

(Took Took is there - leaving for Kochi by train - drive to the train station)

It is heavy enough with one child and now there is a second one growing in my
belly

Shall I make an abortion? No one would know about that. I almost killed myself
once...How can I cancel the life which doesn't truly belong to me? Should I not
leave that decision to the child?

(India can be VERY overwhelming and so can be unexpected pregnancy, when
combined they lead one to the state of deep despair)

Eduard comes to India for support and they go to Goa: 

first Agonda, then Arambol and then they fly to Switzerland

Andalusia - sudden discovery of a yoga and breathwork retreat in the hills of
Andalusia 

**August 2004**

Throughout his life Eduard was not very talkative outside of the family. Within
the family he wasn’t a chatter box either, however he loved both children and
we (he and I) talked about pretty much everything, as well. And at times – yes,
he absolutely was a chatterbox. And this were memorable moments, as well. Both
children were off the breast for quite some time now and the question “What’s
next” resurfaced again. 

Point of entry - Madrid 

(was pretty boring)

Funnily enough exactly in Spain and not in India I was initially introduced to
yoga and breath work techniques. (even though she was to India, first)

Or maybe it was last A of AIDA - awareness, interest, desire, action(s)

Yoga & Breathwork Introduction: 

Early 2000s Spain 

(especially Andalusia—think Sierra Nevada foothills, olive groves, white
villages) had a growing alternative scene: small retreats in fincas, influenced
by Ibiza's hippie legacy and incoming Europeans. 

Pranayama, Hatha and Vinyasa yoga, early breath workshops were there—perfect
seed for her later ice-breath control.

It’s a luxury only a few can afford themselves nowadays to get lost in the hill
of Andalusia without any plans or agenda. And this is exactly where I see them
– doing yoga in the morning rose-pink light. And something in mir says – yes,
it is them, this is exactly where I supposed to be. Introduction into yoga and
breathwork

## One, two, three … swimming we go. Ice swimming.

She met and swam with Iceman – Wim Hof; first, with some other participants of
one of the courses he gives Women of beauty like hers don’t go unnoticed and
later she swam with Stig Severinsen and she also swam with lesser known female
ice swimmers like:Johanna NordbladElina Mäkinen 

This is such a bold, symbolic choice. 

Cold-water/ice swimming is literally about confronting death—numbing pain,
controlled breath, pushing the body to the brink—and then emerging alive,
exhilarated, reborn. It's the perfect metaphor for post-asylum Veronika:
someone who has already "died" once and now actively seeks out near-death
experiences not to end life, but to feel alive as intensely as possible.

## Madness or Bravery

swimming in ice-cold waters alone 

Now when I already swam with some of the world most renowned ice swimmers I
also wanted to try the cold waters of Iceland. Is it a sign of bravery or a
sigh of an absolute and sheer madness to wager into such a swim absolutely
alone?It is way easier to swim with the others, however to do it completely
alone… One needs to confront one’s own fears and either overcome them or
succumb and surrender to them and this is exactly what I was doing when the
thoughts of fear came to my headFuck it let’s do it, nothing is under control –
is the motto which I welcomed into my life and was using when faced by
situations of uncertainty, fear and even danger

There are calculable risks and there is sheer madness and mad braveryWhat
swimming alone is, only the time will show. Ask me later and I’ll tell you once
I did / have done it. 

The title "Iceland" works well for now: it’s simple, geographic, and carries
that stark, cold resonance. If you want alternatives later, something like
"Alone in the North Atlantic", "The Solitary Plunge", or "Madness or Bravery"
(echoing the question you pose) could add a more poetic or philosophical layer.
But honestly, the plain "Iceland" has a Coelho-esque minimalism that fits the
spirit of the original novel.

Some of the content of this chapter was inspired by Jill Bolte and her talks 

For one of them there is the link below:

https://www.ted.com/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_my_stroke_of_insight

Once I woke up from coma, in that moment, I knew that I was no longer the
choreographer of my life. 

And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life, 

or this was perhaps my moment of transition. 

When I woke, it already was an afternoon, 

I was enormously surprised to discover that I was still alive. 

When I felt my spirit surrender, I said goodbye to my life. 

And my mind was now suspended 

between two very opposite planes of reality. 

Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems 

felt like pure pain. 

Light burned my brain like wildfire, 

and sounds were so loud and chaotic 

that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise, 

and I just wanted to escape. 

Because I could not identify the position of my body in space, 

I felt enormous and expansive, 

like a genie just liberated from her bottle. 

And my spirit soared free, 

like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria. 

Nirvana. 

I found Nirvana, again. 

And I remember thinking, 

there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself 

back inside this tiny little body. 

But then I realized, "But I'm still alive! 

I'm still alive, and I experienced Nirvana, again. 

And if I could experience Nirvana again, while being alive, 

then everyone who is alive can experience it, too" 

And I pictured a world 

filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people 

who knew that they could come to this space at any time. 

And that they could purposely choose 

to step to the right hemisphere – by doing yoga and meditations -

and find this peace. 

And then I realized 

what a tremendous gift this experience could be, 

what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives. 

And it motivated me to recover and to come back. 

So who are we? 

We are the life-force power of the universe, 

with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds. 

And we have the power to choose, moment by moment, 

who and how we want to be in the world. 

Right here, right now, 

I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere, where we are. 

I am the life-force power of the universe. 

I am the life-force power 

of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form, 

at one with all that is. 

Or, I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere, 

where I become a single individual, a solid. 

Separate from the flow, separate from you. 

I am Veronika

intellectual, journalist, TV presenter and story-teller, caring mother to my
children and loving wife to my husband and daughter to my parents. 

These are the "we" inside of me. 

Which would you choose? 

Which do you choose? 

And when? 

I believe that the more time we spend 

choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry 

of our right hemispheres, 

the more peace we will project into the world, 

and the more peaceful our planet will be. 

And I thought that was an ideal time to live the life I was given, again. 

Recovery

Death of Dr. Igor

How long do I still have?

A journey to get into Gaza. 

Once I woke up from the coma in Ljubljana, the venom finally flushed from my
veins, I knew I was no longer the sole choreographer of my life. I had felt my
spirit surrender. I had said goodbye — quietly, almost gratefully — to the
story I had been writing with every border crossed, every icy plunge, every
reckless yes. Light had burned like wildfire behind my eyes, sounds had crashed
like chaos, and for a while I was enormous — a genie freed from the bottle of
my body, gliding through silent euphoria. Nirvana. I had found it. And then I
woke up. Still alive. Again. I remember thinking: if I can touch that vastness
and still be breathing, then anyone can. Everyone who is alive can choose, at
any moment, to step into that space of deep peace. And in the same breath, they
can choose the smaller, sharper “I” — the one with a name, a passport, children
waiting at home, a husband who paints while the polar night lasts. These two
“we” live inside me. One is the life-force power of the universe — boundless,
at one with everything, fearless because there is no edge to fall off. The
other is Veronika: intellectual, journalist, TV presenter, storyteller, mother
to my quiet blond boy and fiery black-haired girl, loving wife to Eduard,
daughter to my parents. I have spent decades running the circuitry of intensity
— chasing sensation to prove I was still here. But in that coma I learned I
could also run the circuitry of peace. And suddenly the running stopped feeling
necessary. I came home different. I stayed longer. I watched the children grow.
I sat with Eduard in silence that didn’t itch. For the first time, ordinary
days didn’t terrify me. But the world kept burning. Images reached me: children
in Gaza, thin as winter twigs, eyes carrying the same hollow question I once
carried in Villette. Famine declared, temperatures brutal, homes reduced to
rubble mountains, aid crawling in too late. I understood then what the second
chance was truly for. Not to sit safely in the peace I had found. 

But to carry it into the places where peace had been bombed out of existence.
One last time, I left. Eduard kissed me at the airport the way he always did —
no pleas, no drama, just trust and the quiet knowledge that I might not return.
The children hugged me harder than usual. They were old enough now to feel the
weight. I entered Gaza in August 2025. It was a blast that deformed yet another
piece of a building, now resembling the rest of the nearly completely
demolished neighborhood…\[Continue directly with the exact Gaza text you
already wrote, ending on:]…And in the end, the machine took me too. 

I came home different. They had flown me to Ljubljana in May, while I was still
deep in the coma — back to the city where the story began, back to hospital
corridors that once rang with my fury at surviving. When I finally woke, late
spring was already turning the city green. For the first time in decades, I
stayed. Not forever — just those couple of months while my body finished
healing, while Ljubljana’s grey winter memories from the past faded into a
hesitant spring and then a full, warm summer. The children were already grown —
our quiet blond boy and fiery black-haired girl now in their mid-twenties,
shaping lives of their own. 

Our girl found her rooting in Columbia as an English teacher. 

and 

our boy stayed in the UK, well, at least for now. His IT start-up is promising
and he might need to relocate to the US. The time will show. 

They came and went, bringing their new sharpness and laughter into the house.
We shared long meals on the terrace, walks along the river, silences with
Eduard that felt full instead of restless. Life became quieter, deeper. The old
terror of ordinary days receded — like a tide that had learned it could ebb
without drowning me. The running stopped. 

For one summer. For a few very short months. Then, one hot morning in early
August 2025, the news reached me. Dr. Igor — the psychiatrist, who had once
lied that my heart was failing, the lie that hurled me into life — had died
suddenly of a massive heart attack. 

They flew me home to Ljubljana while I was still unconscious — back to the city
where it all began, back to the same hospital corridors that once echoed with
my rage at being alive. When I woke from the coma, the venom finally purged, I
knew I was no longer the sole choreographer of my life. I had surrendered. I
had said goodbye — not in despair this time, but in a vast, silent euphoria.
Light had burned like wildfire, sounds had crashed like chaos, and for a while
I was boundless — a genie freed from the bottle of my body, gliding through an
ocean of peace. Nirvana. I had touched it. And then I woke up. Still alive.
Again. The doctors told me later how close it had been. Eduard had sat by my
bed for weeks, painting nothing, just holding my hand through the long polar
night. The children had taken turns reading to me. My parents had prayed. I
remember thinking: if I can touch that vastness and still return to this small
body, then anyone can. Everyone who is alive can choose, moment by moment,
which circuitry to run — the deep inner peace of boundlessness, or the sharp,
separate “I” with a name, a history, people waiting. These two “we” live inside
me. One is the life-force power of the universe — at one with everything,
fearless because there are no edges. The other is Veronika: journalist,
storyteller, mother to my quiet blond boy and fiery black-haired girl, loving
wife to Eduard, daughter to my parents. For decades I had run only the
circuitry of intensity, chasing proof that I was still here. But in that coma I
learned I could also choose peace. And for the first time, ordinary days no
longer felt like a slow death. I stayed home longer. I watched the children
finish growing. I sat with Eduard in silences that felt full, not empty. Life
became quieter, deeper. The running stopped. Then, one grey Ljubljana morning
in early 2025, the news reached me. Dr. Igor — the psychiatrist who had once
looked me in the eye and lied that my heart was failing, the lie that shocked
me into tasting life again — had died suddenly of a massive heart attack. Irony
doesn’t even begin to cover it. I went to the funeral. Stood in the rain with
the handful of people who remembered Villette the way it used to be. And in
that moment, watching his coffin lowered into Slovenian soil, I understood what
the second unchosen return was truly for. Not to retreat into private peace. 

But to carry it outward — into the places where peace had been declared dead.
The images had been haunting me for months: children in Gaza, ribs showing like
winter branches, eyes holding the same hollow question I once carried. Famine
official now, heat merciless, entire neighbourhoods reduced to rubble
mountains, aid blocked or destroyed. Dr. Igor had — through his desperate lie —
handed me decades I hadn’t asked for. 

Now someone was trying to steal decades from children who had never even had
the chance to despair. One last time, I packed a small bag. Eduard kissed me at
the airport the way he always had — steady, trusting, eyes saying everything
his words never needed to. The children, now adults carrying our flame, hugged
me harder than usual. They knew. I entered Gaza in August 2025. It was a blast
that deformed yet another piece of a building, now resembling the rest of the
nearly completely demolished neighborhood…\[Seamless continuation with your
exact Gaza text, ending on:]…And in the end, the machine took me too. 

She begins the story waking up in a Ljubljana hospital, furious to be alive
after trying to die. 

She ends the arc waking up in the same city, same kind of hospital bed, after a
coma she didn’t choose — this time calm, illuminated, ready to live without the
old terror. And the trigger for Gaza being the death of Dr. Igor — the very
doctor who once told her “you have only days to live” (sparking her original
awakening) now dying suddenly of a heart attack himself — that’s the irony
dialed to eleven. The man who accidentally saved her life by lying about her
heart now loses his own heart. It’s almost cruelly perfect. 

August 2025

Veronika is smuggled into Gaza

## Veronika decides to live

August 2025

EXT - on street in Gaza - DAY

(Veronika speaks in Arabic to children she wants to lead to shelter)

OS - COMMs between military 

COMMANDER

There is something suspicions in the Sector XYZ. Send a drone there.

DRONE PILOT

Done, sir. 

Drone in the sky above Gaza

(Camera follows a rocket leaving fiery trail in the sky and flying towards a
building and crashing into it)

CONT'D 

EXT - on street in Gaza - DAY

(devastation - partially or fully demolished building - heat and smoke) 

It was a blast that deformed yet another piece of a building, now resembling
the rest of the nearly completely demolished neighborhood…she's saving five
specific kids:Twins 6 y.o. : Jamal and Amal (girl, scared of the drone
sounds)Omar (5, boy, holding his sister's hand), Noor (girl) 8 y.o. and Yasmin
(3, crying, won't let go of a stuffed animal)We need to SEE her:Learning their
names in broken ArabicWiping dust from Yasmin's faceTelling them: "We're going
to run to that building, okay? On three. One, two..."Then the drone strikes.Not
abstract. Not distant. Specific bodies. Specific loss.I had gathered them— all
five of them children, wide-eyed and “starved to the bone” thin, their small
hands clutching mine as I whispered promises of a safer place just beyond the
rubble. We moved quickly through the choking dust, past twisted metal and
shattered homes, toward what I hoped was shelter. They trusted me, this
stranger with the foreign accent who spoke of gardens and cold waters far away.
I was trying to save them, to lead them out of this furnace of heat and
destruction. But the next blast came without warning. The ground erupted.
Bodies flew like fragile leaves in a storm. When the smoke settled, the
children lay still. They would never see their parents again, nor their
siblings, friends, or neighbors. Neither would I.War is a heartless machine, a
creation of politicians. It takes no precautions and differentiates nothing
among beings: be it a cat, a dog, a child, or a grown-up. Heat and destruction
are bad partners; add dust and smoke, and you have a nearly apocalyptic premise
laid out right before our eyes.In that moment, as the scorching August sun
burned down on the ruins of Gaza City— where famine had taken hold weeks
earlier and the temperatures soared past 40°C and aid trickled like blood from
a dying wound — I felt the old paradox rise in me one final time. Bravery or
madness? All my life, I had plunged into extremes to feel alive: the icy waters
of Iceland shocking my skin, the viper's bite in Auroville sending me into coma
darkness, the spiritual fires of India and Amazonia burning away illusions. I
had decided to live, over and over—escaping Villete with Eduard, building our
wild love, raising our quiet blond boy and fiery black-haired girl amid moves
and gardens across the world. And now, here in this man-made hell, I had come
not for myself, but for them. For the starving, the displaced, the children
whose eyes mirrored my own long-ago despair. One last plunge, into the heart of
indifference. As my vision faded amid the rubble, I thought of Eduard’s
paintings, the children grown and carrying our flame, the piano notes from
Villete echoing faintly. I had lived by other laws. I had chosen sanity over
madness and bravery over indifference. And in the end, the machine took me too.

End with a scene of one person we've never met—maybe a teenage girl in
Ljubljana—reading Veronika's book in a hospital bed (echo of Villete). She's
considering suicide. She reads the last page. She closes the book. She looks
out the window.She decides to live and her name is Veronika, too! and she is a
daughter of Ukrainian refugees.

DAY 1 - Initial coldness

MARIJA(cheerful, from her bed)What's your name, dear?

VERONIKA II doesn't turn around. Stares at the wall.

VERONIKA II(flat, doing her a "favor")Veronika.

MARIJA(warm, unfazed)Ah! Beautiful name. My mother's name was Veronika.I'm
Marija.

VERONIKA II(barely audible)Okay. She turns her back to Marija. Pulls the
blanket over her head.

Marija watches her for a moment—then goes back to knitting. She hums softly. A
Slovenian folk song.

DAY 2 - Marija's daughter visits

VERONIKA II pretends to sleep. 

Marija's DAUGHTER (40s, kind face) brings a bag of food, magazines, and two
books.

DAUGHTER

Here's the books you asked for, Mama.

MARIJA(taking it, glancing at Veronika II's turned back)

Thank you, ljubica. After some time the daughter leaves. Marija reads for a
while—then places the book on the shared nightstand between the beds. Cover
facing up: "Veronika Decides to Live."

Veronika II's eyes flicker open—just for a second—to see the title. She closes
them again.

DAY 3 - The thaw 

VERONIKA II 

wakes in the night. Can't sleep. Reaches for the book—hesitates—then pulls it
into her hands. Starts reading by the dim nightlight. 

MARIJA 

stirs, half-awake. 

MARIJA(sleepy, gentle) 

Good book, that one. Made me cry. 

Veronika II 

freezes—caught. 

VERONIKA II 

(defensive) 

I wasn't

MARIJA

(cutting her off, kind)

It's okay. Read it. Keep it, if you want. 

She rolls over, goes back to sleep. Veronika II stares at the book. Then keeps
reading.

DAY 4/5 - Marija is discharged

MARIJA packs her things. 

Veronika II watches from her bed—hasn't spoken much, but her posture is
different. Less defensive.

MARIJA (at the door, turning back) Veronika? Veronika II looks up.

MARIJA 

(CONT'D)

(simply, no drama)

I'm glad I met you. She smiles—warm, genuine—and leaves. Veronika II is alone
now. She looks at the books still on the nightstand. Picks it up. Keeps reading.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LJUBLJANA - DAY (JANUARY 2026)

Pale winter light filters through the window. 

VERONIKA II (16) sits propped up in bed with the book in her hands — final
pages. She reads in silence. Her jaw tightens. Her eyes redden—but she doesn't
cry. She finishes the last sentence. Closes the book slowly. Stares at the
cover: "Veronika decides to live" 

VERONIKA II

(whispered, in Ukrainian-accented Slovene)

Ty durna zhinka.(You stupid woman.)

She looks out the window—the city sprawls below, gray and ordinary and full of
people living their small, precious lives.

VERONIKA II (CONT'D)

(softer, to the book)

But you tried. She places the book on the bedside table—carefully, like it's
sacred. Reaches for the call button.Presses it.VERONIKA II (CONT'D)(to herself,
almost a vow)Okay. I'll try, too.She looks back out the window. The city is
still gray. But the light is different now.

CUT TO

EXT - MOUNTAINS OVERLOOKING OCEAN - DAY

VERONIKA, HER HUSBAND AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN are hiking in the mountains. 

TITLE CARD:"For everyone still deciding."

Outro

Now when you finished reading the book, Life is too short, no matter how many
years you’ve lived and whatever you do with your life is up to you. But if this
reaches you—reader, witness—remember: decide to live. Not just for yourself.
Change the world, in whatever capacity you can. Plant a garden. Speak truth.
Act. Before the apocalypse claims us all. 

**Veronika Decides to Live - Complete Story Outline**

## Core Concept

A continuation of Paulo Coelho's "Veronika Decides to Die" - following
Veronika's journey from choosing life after her suicide attempt to her heroic
death in Gaza 27 years later.

**Central Theme:** She decides to live (fiercely, repeatedly, defiantly) → dies
saving others

**The Question:** Life is for using what you've been given (time, privilege,
survival) to protect life where it's most threatened.

**TITLE CARD:** *"For everyone still deciding."*

## Key Thematic Threads

### The Three Colds

1.  **Thailand (Decision):** "If you cannot beat it, become friends with it"
2.  **Ice Swimming (Practice):** Training, integration, mastery
3.  **Iceland (Integration):** Alone, complete, at peace

### India Frames the Story

- **1999:** Departure (with baby, breastfeeding, discovering second pregnancy)
- **2025:** Return (viper bite, coma, transformation)

### The Comet Metaphor

- She burns bright
- Returns periodically to Eduard (her sun)
- Kids orbit in their own paths
- Final burn: Gaza
- Trail continues: Veronika II

### Survivors' Arc

- Pills didn't kill her
- Viper didn't kill her
- Dr. Igor dead
- Children in Gaza dead
- **Survivors' guilt → Survivors' responsibility**

### The Answer to "What For?"

**Early:** Proving suicide attempt wrong through intensity collection **Middle:**
"What is it ALL for?" returns despite full life **Late:** Life is for using what
you've been given to protect life where it's most threatened **Final:** Not
running FROM numbness, running TOWARD meaning

- - -
## Scenes Still Needed

### Chapter 15-18 (2020-2025)

1.  **Iceland plunge feels empty** \- first time thrill is gone, mechanical
2.  **Dr. Igor's funeral** \- detailed, emotional, remembering Villete
3.  **Coma fever dream** \- fragmented, layered, premonitory
4.  **Conversation with Eduard post-coma** \- "You're going somewhere, aren't
    you?"
5.  **Scene with daughter** \- "TBD"

### Gaza Sequence

1.  **Arrival/smuggling**
2.  **Documentary filming**
3.  **Meeting the five children** \- twins Jamal & Amal, Noor, Omar, Yasmin -
    names, faces, specific details
4.  **Final moments** \- intimate, specific, devastating - all five children with
    her

### Epilogue Details (Chapter 18: Outro)

1.  **Eduard scattering ashes** \- in Aare river, Bern (where studio overlooked)
2.  **Son's foundation launch** \- funding humanitarian aid workers, named after
    Veronika
3.  **Daughter with Doctors Without Borders** \- continuing the fire
4.  **Stranger fostering refugees** \- after reading her book
5.  **Iceland garden plaque** \- "Inspired by Veronika"
6.  **Other ripples** \- people she touched, lives she changed unknowingly

- - -
## Structural Notes

- **Format:** Novel in LibreOffice (.odt), Screenplay in Markdown (.md)
- **Tone:** Direct, visceral, no excessive formatting
- **Voice:** Veronika's POV for most, shifts for epilogue
- **Pacing:** Episodic but cumulative, building toward Gaza inevitability
- **Length:** 18 chapters

- - -
## Writing Principles

1.  **Show her full potential throughout** \- so readers feel the waste of her
    death
2.  **Make Gaza intimate and specific** \- not abstract heroism
3.  **End with ripple effect** \- impact she'll never see
4.  **Veronika II closes the spiral** \- not a loop, a continuation
5.  **No preaching** \- let the story carry the message
6.  **Readers should:** WEEP first, then JUMP off their butts to change the world

- - -
## The Dual Goal

1.  **Emotional Impact:** Make readers weep at the waste of potential, the beauty
    of trying, the tragedy of Gaza
2.  **Call to Action:** Inspire readers to change the world in their capacity,
    leave places better than they found them

## Copyright & Collaboration Notes

- Continuation of Coelho's work (copyrighted)
- Seeking female co-author
- Can develop: characters, scenes, emotional beats, structural choices,
  dialogue, thematic depth
- Not direct co-authoring, but serious developmental partnership with several
  AIs

## Preparing for India

to display struggle of getting visa Embassy in Vienna Getting ALL documents
Getting there INT - Indian Embassy / Consulate VIENNA - DAY (Interview) EMBASSY
/ CONSULATE CLERK Why do you want 6 months visa? VERONIKA You have a beautiful
country (Moving around the city - sightseeing; stopping at a cafe or restaurant
to breastfeed the boy and eat) (Return into the hotel at dark) INT - Hotel room
\- NIGHT (Veronika breastfeeds the boy and both fall asleep with the baby still
sucking on the breast) FADE OUT NEXT DAY - SLOW FADE IN (to still sleeping
Veronika and boy; they gradually wake up; Veronika breastfeeds the boy) INT -
Breakfast room - MORNING (friendly chitchat with some breakfast table
neighbours) INT - Indian consulate - DAY (Getting the passport back with the
issued visa) (Veronika walks out of the building, while holding the passport in
her hand. Veronika stops, opens it to check the accuracy) CAMERA SHOT INTO THE
PASSPORT OPENED DISPLAYING INDIAN VISA 

// I'm still not sure if I should include it into the book or not EXT - Outside
of Embassy - DAY VERONIKA (angrily) Fuck! (going back to the gates) There is a
mistake. It's not my family name. EMBASSY GUARD Ma..am, you need to come
tomorrow again. Do we want to go the path of the visa issued with an error, you
have to come tomorrow; strong emotional reaction of Veronika, time needed to
correct the visa, another night in hotel, etc ??? OC What doesn't kill us,
makes us stronger...

BACK in Bern INT - Bedroom - NIGHT After she has packed everything and put boy
to bed, she set up the baby phone and went to / came into Eduard's studio....
She knew that she has got at least 2 - 3 hours before she would need to feed
the boy... VO (in Veronika voice) Normal women, who breastfeed usually lose
their libido during the breastfeeding time - not me though, my libido has
actually become amplified (parting sex (which was initiated by Veronika) and
which will conceive their daughter) <- this will be deleted later from the book
/ script INT - EDUARD'S STUDIO ROOM - NIGHT Veronika enters the studio with a
thick wool blanket over her shoulder Kisses Eduard Steps away and spreads out
the blanket on the floor while Eduard amused and in bewilderment watches what
Veronika is doing She half lies down onto the blanket and waves with the hand
to Eduard to come (come, come) The whole day she was preparing herself for this
\- she rubbed herself against him like a horny cat in May - in the kitchen, in
his studio - when she came to call him for lunch and dinner to his bewilderment
keeping him thinking what is actually going on today :) When he came to the
blanket and copied her pose she pressed him onto his shoulders, him ending up
lying on his back and ... she kissed and rode him, she rode and kissed him very
well that night. In the morning Eduard drives them to the airport. They kiss
and she waves goodbye, after having entered the gate.

## India

(entry New Delhi November 1999) DATE / PLACE DISPLAY ON SCR. November 1999, New
Delhi New Delhi North India Agra Lucknow Mumbai Chennai Puducherry Varkala some
persistent interest from a male over several days He was very well behaved and
extremely polite ALL the fucking time and this appalled me and on the other
hand made him extremely attractive for me. When I was returning from the yoga
session for mothers - there were all kind of women there: Russian, Indian,
Australian and me; I was not in my best shape and yet he has overshowered me
with compliments for how beautiful I am and how great I look. INT - some
restaurant overlooking ocean - DAY (Veronika and male have a conversation,
while Veronika breastfeeds the boy) INT - Veronika's hotel room - SAME DAY kiss
scene He starts gently undress her She plays with his hair sudden vomit
reaction (Veronika) Veronika runs into the bathroom I apologised and run into
the bathroom The guy remained staying speechless for some time and then just
left the male being the gentlemen leaves while she is still in the bathroom (so
she discovers / becomes aware that she is pregnant) (Emotional break down) FADE
OUT EXT - Outside of the hotel - NEXT DAY (Took Took is there - leaving for
Kochi - drive to the train station) VO (in Veronika voice) It is heavy enough
with one child and now there is a second one growing in my belly CONT'D VO (in
Veronika voice) shall I make an abortion? No one would know about that (What
stops her from having that abortion? What stops her from having abortion in the
end?) VO (in Veronika voice) I almost killed myself once... How can I cancel
the life which doesn't truly belong to me? Should I not leave that decision to
the child? (India can be VERY overwhelming and so can be unexpected pregnancy,
when combined they lead one to the state of deep despair) Eduard comes to India
for support and they go to Goa: first Agonda and then Arambol and then return
to Switzerland

## Journey into friendship with cold begins.

South-East Asia (work) Bangkok North Thailand Journey into friendship with cold
begins. EXT - North Thailand - NIGHT VO (in Veronika voice) It supposed to be
warm in tropical countries – however being here in December in the North of
Thailand has brought the memories of North India. EPISODE EXT - North India -
NIGHT (flashback to the time when Veronika was in the North India) (Veronika is
having warm clothes in the mountains of North India) CONT'D VO (in Veronika
voice) It's fucking great that we left for India in November, when it was
already pretty cold in Slovenia, otherwise we would be freezing our bones here.
EXT - North Thailand - NIGHT CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice) Somehow I didn't
know that it would be the same in Thailand. (If you cannot beat them, join them
or in my case it was if you cannot beat it, get accustomed to it, make yourself
friends with it, and this is exactly where and how my journey into making
friend with cold has started. Ironically in a very warm tropical country.) It's
good that we flew here in December and had our warm clothes with us. CONT'D VO
(in Veronika voice) My whole life is an absolute irony of my choices, of me
making those choices and living with them. EXT - PATH UP THE MOUNTAIN - MORNING
(Veronika went for a run and a swim in a cold-ish mountain lake overcoming fear
of water) FLASHBACK TO CHILDHOOD EXT - LAKE - DAY (little Veronika is drowning
in a lake) (when she was a child and nearly drowned and was saved by ....
whom?) CONT'D EXT - PATH UP THE MOUNTAIN - MORNING (Veronika runs into the
water and dives) Well, that didn't kill me. 

(Decision to “become friends with cold” despite tropical latitude — internal
paradox established.)

## Rush for life

Auroville clinique coma & return to Slovenia And I ended up in hospital, again.
In a hospital similar to Villette I don't know about Eduard, however I
passionately hated ALL hospitals after Villette and something in my gut tells
me that Eduard might've shared my sentiment. Seeing everything what was
happening around me in the hospital and beyond and not being able to change
anything is - I don't know how to put it mildly - disheartening.
