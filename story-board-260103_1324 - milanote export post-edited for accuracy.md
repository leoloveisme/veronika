EPISODE

EXT - North India - NIGHT

(flashback to the time when Veronika was in the North India)

(Veronika is having warm clothes in the mountains of North India)

CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice)

It's fucking great that we left for India in November, when it was already
pretty cold in Slovenia, otherwise we would be freezing our bones here in the
tropical country.\\ If you cannot beat them, join them or in my case it was if
you cannot beat it, get accustomed to it, make yourself friends with it, and
this is exactly where and how my journey into making friend with cold has
started. Ironically in a very warm tropical country.

CONT'D VO (in Veronika voice)

My whole life is an absolute irony of my choices, of me making those choices
and living with them.

- - -
Decision to “become friends with cold” despite tropical latitude — internal
paradox established.
